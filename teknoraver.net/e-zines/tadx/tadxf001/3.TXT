ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE is offered by a local
Telecommunication Administration equipped with BT TYMNET technology.
In many instances the administration is using BT TYMNET's Network
Supervisors to operate the packet service in their area.

All ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE locations offer direct TYM2
(TYMNET's proprietary) protocol connection to the BT TYMNET Public
Network and thus may offer BT's comprehensive array of enhanced
protocol services.  Most currently offer BT TYMNET asynchronous
access and X.25 service.  Naturally, a close affinity exists between
BT and ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE providers so a very high
degree of service and support exists in these locations.  TYMUSA, a
universal dial-up service which is billed back to the customer's home
office, is offered from all the above locations.

BASIC GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE providers connect their networks to
BT TYMNET exclusively via X.75 protocol gateways.  The CCITT
recommendation X.75 is closely related to the better known CCITT X.25
recommendation and provides a reliable communication channel for
interworking between Public Data Networks.

As a supplier of network technology to US IRC's and foreign carriers
for more than 10 years,  BT has a wealth of experience with the X.75
standard and actively participates in its development.  BT TYMNET
X.75 software has evolved into a sophisticated product providing
numerous advanced features not found in other X.75 implementations.
BT maintains and supports more X.75 gateway links than any other
network in the world.

All of BT's X.75 gateways are supported by BT's International Network
Services group which ensures that all the gateways are configured to
provide  a  uniform  interface to BT TYMNET regardless of the
origination network.

BPS:  Bits per second is an information transfer rate.  BPS
is the number of bits that can be represented each second
on a communication facility or device communication port.


CCITT:  Comite Consultatif International de Telephonie et

covering telephony and telegraphy have international
influence among telecommunications engineers,
manufacturers, and administrators.

CHARACTER:  Letter, figure, number, punctuation, or other
sign contained in a message.  Because data is handled and
transferred as a series of characters, the term in also
used to mean one bit pattern in a specific data code.

CONNECT TIME:  The length of time a communications channel
is in use for each transmission.  Includes both message
time and operating time.

DNIC: Data Network Identification Code:  Every DNIC
consists of 4 digits.  The first three digits should always
identify a country and could be regarded as a Data Country
Code (DCC).  The fourth, or network digit, should identify
a specific data network in the country.

KILOSEGMENT (Kseg): 1000 segments.

KILOCHARACTER (Kchar): 1000 characters.

NUI: Network User Identifier.  Required only for dialup

PROTOCOL:  A set of rules or instructions for carrying out
a particular function.

PTT:  Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Organization, usually
a governmental department that acts as its nation's common

SEGMENT:  A chargeable unit of volume.  One segment is 0-64
octets (qv) of data.

TRANSMISSION: Sending information in the form of electrical
signals over electric wires, waveguides, or radio.

X.25:  CCITT recommendation that specifies the interface
between user data terminal equipment (DTE) and
packet-switching data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE).

X.75: A standard for connecting X.25 networks; developed by
