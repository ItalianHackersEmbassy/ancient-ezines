þ Welcome back

  Welcome back. Rather than waste time with superficial pettiness, I have
decided to try and make this issue a spontaneous sort of thing.  I just want to
see if it will turn out worth shit.  We are using you lamers as guinea pigs.
Eat it up........
  I would like to say hello to everybody, except for North Alabananians and
Prodigy users.  If you think we forgot you, just tell us.  We'll send you a nice
Hallmark Shoebox card or something as a GR@@T.

þ Explanation

  I didn't draw anything because I didn't feel like it.

þ Mail

  Actually, this entire issue could encompass all of the nice, wholesome things
I have to say about the succeeding piece of mail, but I will refrain.  Let us
read on.  This is very sad, so get your Kleenex and cry for this lamer.

RE: Sad-ass ANSi



   See, that's the difference between you and me. Your whole life is based
on status and connections in the bbs world. See, to me, I really don't
care, all I care about is to get the software I need, and that's all.
This whole "nation wide" bullshit is all the same to me. You same I'm lame
because of I have no connections, well, I have enough to keep my system
going and sofourth. I do rely on a VBBS lamer to get my software for me,
but I am getting what I want.....not as fast or as good as what you proabably
pull in daily, but it works for me. I mean not to attempt to insult
you by saying that you are only worried about status or whatever, it's
just our difference. I'm not try to say I am anybody. As far as the national
status thing, you're right...I suck....but I HAVE beenÿÿÿ on a vision test
site...I didn't have full access because of my shitty baud rate....and I
didn't contribute, because they were months ahead of me. My point is just that
you are so sure that I am trying to be a "hacker" or whatever. I have SOME
access to some stuff, probably old to you, but it's ok for me. And I do
know ENOUGH pascal to get along. But that's it. I'm tired of arguing with you,
it's not getting either one of us anywhere...and that ansi sucks, but I ran
across it on floppy, and I just felt like doing it.....for the hell
of it. (It's lame, I know). The only thing I can say that I've DONE really
is beige box, and fuck up this girls car by scrubbing toothpaste on the
stabler bar(steering strut thingy in the front)....and I made some thermite
once...but that's it. I have some amature knowledge of electronics, and a fair
knowledge of the phone system too. I can't compare myself to you or Chris in
these areas. Those ViSiON specs are real...the guy told me. I recognize that
I am at a terrible dissadvantage here, but if you do come to my house or
something, then oh well. Not like you'de have the guts to do anything...and if
you did, it would be covered by insurance......no biggy.
  And you can blacklist me from every board around...don't care. Just have
to call Fort Worth or something. And if you haven't found anyone on my side
in Fort Worth, then you haven't run across Assasinator(Dipeche Node BBS)
or any PyroNet people, or any TNT people. (that's like 30 total). That's
not many, but it's all the people I had in Ft. Worth in the nets or
helping me with different shit. Also, Igniter helped me with some things, but
he really doesn't count as a connection.

    I'm not kissing ass....I'm just letting you know once and for all
how I feel. If you kill me or something, oh well...huntsville is about
to make me kill myself. And those are our differences.....

   I REPEAT("I am NOT trying to say that I am something I'm NOT. You WIN!
ok? Now , go find some warez, ok?")

   You live for a new version of everyhing, don't you?

  Actually,  NO COURiER is not a household a name.  Surprise.  I have yet to do
anything special with a trinket out of a cereal box.  About the best thing I've
come up with was using a Fruit Loops propeller beenee as a sex toy with your
mom.  It was interesting.  Unfortunately, the rubber band borke in an hour.
  I am not saying you are lame becuase nobody likes you.  I am saying you are
lame because you have yet to be brutally murdered.

  VBBS o/DaY WaRe?  So you just got PC Lemmings?  I'm so proud of you.  You
logged on to a ViSiON test site.  I didn't know that "APPLY" was one of your
aliases.

  No, no.  You are definately not a hacker.  Hackers don't try to drop to DOS in
WWiV with PKUNZIP.BAT.
  Arguing?  But I've just begun!  I like to argue.  It promotes disorder,
unrest, and violence.  PHPHPHPHun.  I know enough QuickBasic to write a shitty
BBS program.  So what's your point?
  Yhea, the ANSi was sad.  Just what I expect from you.  I'm sure you had an
ANSi just for me sitting on a floppy.  It's time you create an ANSi group.

  Toothpaste?  Thermite? No response needed.  Electronics... phones...  Does a
9-Volt battery and the ATDT command count?
  Whether old-ass ViSiON v.97 has Stack problems or not has not a thing to do
with your inability to configure it.  You're just plain idiotic.  That isn't a
software problem.

 Y'know what, campers?  We really WEREN'T going to go to the guy's house, but I
guess we have to now.  I'll bring my Polaroid.  We'll make a loader.

 Go ahead and call Fort Worth, lamer.  You won't have much luck there, either.
Well, maybe you will.  It depends on whether you call a real board or a K_RaD
TNT board.  Necro had never heard of you.  That's weird.  Of course, I don't
think he is on your level.  TNT never was, and it if it was it is dead.  We had
nothing to with this.  Perhaps it is the fact that such alliances don't last.

  Damn...  you just ramble on like a FREAK, don't you?!?!?  You think that we're
gonna' kill you?

    Everybody SING!

  Did it with my woman 'cuz she couldn't help my with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
  All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
'Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pass it by
    Can you help me occupy my brain?
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can find
  I can't see the things that make true happiness
    I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
  Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words I'm telling you now from my stake
  I tell you to enjoy life
    I wish I could, but it's too late.

  You have always been trying to say that you are more than what you really are.
I win.  I always win.  I would go find some new warez, but I don't like VBBS.
  I don't live for a new version of everything, just SuperBBS & Commander Keen.
Old software is one thing, but ViSiON .83 is unacceptable.  DAMN, you suck.

  How would you like to hear some heavy duty, totally awesome, mega rad,
scorching HOT NEWS?  ARE YOU READY? HERE IT IS:
  "But the FEARFUL, the UNBELIEVING, and the ABOMINABLE, and MURDERERS, and
WHOREMONGERS, and SORCERERS, and IDOLATORS, and ALL LIARS, shall have their part
in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:  which is the second death."
                                                        - Revelation 21:8

  Have you stopped to wonder if YOU were on your way to hell?  Check out this
HOT NEWS about who's going to hell.  Here are the sinners who have freely chosen
to be on the HOT NEWS list, for eternal torment IN THE LAKE OF FIRE:

                   - WHO'S WHO ON THE HELL-BOUND LIST -
‘ The FEARFUL - All cowards who don't live totally committed to God by
                  obeying His Holy Word.
‘ The UNBELIEVING - Any person who has not repented and placed complete and
                      total trust in Jesus Christ for salvation; the unsaved.
‘ The ABOMINABLE - Those who practice immorality.  All Homosexuals, all who view
                      or produce pornographic material, all who lust in their
                      hearts, etc.
‘ The MURDERERS - Those who take others' lives, their own lives (commit suicide)
                      abortionists.
‘ The WHOREMONGERS - Those who have sexual relations with a partner that they're
                      not married to (fornicators, adulterers).
‘ The SORCERERS - Those who use any form of drugs to get intoxicated (high).
                      Those involved in witchcracft, horoscopes, etc.
‘ The IDOLATORS - Those who worship any false god including self, rock-n-roll
                      stars, the Pope, Mary, any statue, Buddha, Mohammed, etc.
                      (An idol is anything including a religious figure or
                      system that you choose to worship above Almighty God).
‘ ALL LIARS - Any person who purposely speaks forth a false statement as truth.

  THESE ARE SOUL-DAMNING SINS!  If you have never received Jesus Christ as your
personal Savior, you are _at least_ an UNBELIEVER and on your way to a place of
torment called hell.  "The wages of sin is DEATH" - Romans 6:23
 Though these sinful practices may be accepted in this last-day liberal society,
they ARE NOT acceptable to God!  God hates sin and he will NOT change!
  "For I am the Lord, I change not."  - Malchi 3:6  Gor WILL judge all who take
part in these wicked activities regardless of what they profess with their
mouths.  God's Holy Word states that He "is able to destroy both soul and body
IN HELL" - Matthew 10:28
  God says, "REPENT ye therefore, and BE CONVERTED, that your sins may be
blotted out" - Acts 3:19  There is only one choice that YOU can make to prevent
unceasing horror and being "cast alive into a lake of fire burning with
brimstone" Revelation 19:20  God commands you to "REPENT" and "BELIEVE" (place
all trust) `on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" - Acts 16:31
  The removal of YOUR SINS was of such major importance to God The Father that
He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to pay a horrible price on
a wooden cross to cleanse you from sin.  Jesus shed His sinless, presious blood
to rescue you from being seperated from God in Hell forever. Jesus died for YOU.
  "For God so loved the world (you), THAT HE GAVE his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth (completely trusts) in him should not perish (in the lake of
fire), but have everlasting life (in Heaven)" - John 3:16  So get off the HOT
NEWS list, BEAT THE BEAT OF HELL, and make some COOL reservations in Heaven by
asking Jesus to be your personal Savior.
                         PRAY THIS PRAYER TO BE SAVED
  Dear God in Heaven, I come to you just as I am, a sinner.  Save me right now,
Lord Jesus.  Please forgive and wash away all my sins.  Thank you for dying for
me and rising from the dead.  Jesus, I confess you right now as my Lord and
Savior.  I decide right now to live a holy and pure life trusting you, Lord
Jesus, with all my Heart.

                       BE BAPTISED, READ YOUR BIBLE, AND
                        PRAY DAILY, AND FELLOWSHIP OFTEN
