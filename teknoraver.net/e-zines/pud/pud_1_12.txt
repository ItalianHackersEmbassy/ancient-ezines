þ BaCK S™ S00N?
  Yes, we are.  We're back with PuD v1#12; yet more ASCii crap to warp your
little minds.  In this issue, we tackle the most complex and mysterious topic of
all: The Meaning of Life.  Yes, we will have some organization in this issue.
All articles relate in some way to the title.  W0w.

þ YoUR LiFE AND MiNE - A SUMMaRY
  We are all somewhere along this chain.  Let's hope that you aren't on link
number one or two.  If you are, go back to your crib and stop reading this.

PHaSE 1:  You are born, with many pains to your mother.
PHaSE 2:  For the next three or four years, you cry a lot.
PHaSE 3:  Preschool.  You are forced to learn the way our society works,
            and you are expected to obey the commands which are handed to you
            by your elders.  You lose your freedom.
PHaSE 4:  Kindergarten.  More bullshit, preparing you for first grade.
PHaSE 5:  Your first year of Elementary school.
PHaSE 6:  Four or five more years of Elementary school, preparing you for
            Junior High.
PHaSE 7:  Junior High.  Three or Four years of preparation for High School.
PHaSE 8:  High School.  Four years of preparation for College, or life.
PHaSE 9:  <Optional> College.  Four to eight years of drunkeness and cramming
             for tests.  Prepare for a boistrous career.
PHaSE 10: <Optional> Armed Forces.  Go to distant, exotic places.  Meet
             interesting people.  Kill them.
PHaSE 11: Find a job.  Work, work, work, waiting to retire.
PHaSE 12: You retire.  You sit around the house, waiting to die.
PHaSE 13: You die.

  Sorry, but THAT'S life.  You have THREE years to be a kid, to have fun without
obligation.  Unfortunately, you are too young to even remember the fun that you
had or would of had if you knew any different.

þ WHY D0eS LiFE SuCK?
  Life sucks because you have to live.  You have to live to know just what it
is, when broken down and analyzed.  What is the point?  Are we really happy?
  No, we're not happy.  You may THiNK you are happy, but that is because society
says you are.  What have you got to be unhappy about?  Your thoughts are being
suppressed.  What you think is what has been prescribed.  You shall never know
what you know, nor shall I for myself.  Think about it, if you are allowed to.

þ WHY D0 YoU SuCK?
  Because I said so.  You're wasting your time reading this when you could be
trying to think through all of the noise created by your warped image of
reality.  Read on; I can't stop you.
   You read on.  You're a real K-RaD ANaRCHiST.

þ THE MeANiNG OF LiFE
  See line 71

þ LiVE AND LEaRN TO Be SUPPReSSED
  Why are our thoughts and feelings suppressed, and replaced with something
acceptable?  We are all the same.  We must all be curbed to allow for the
absolute most idiotic people to keep up.  A greatest common factor of thought.
  Who knows what we think, behind our consciousness?  Nobody does.  We shall
never know, for it is too late for us to change as a whole.  Any one person who
rejects may be ostracized.  You can not wake us up.
