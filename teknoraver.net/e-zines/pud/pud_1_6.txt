  The following is an actual account of a chat on a local WildCat! BBS system.
This segment should give you some insight as to how to confuse simple-minded
WildCat users, as well as their Sysops.  Also, this file just goes to show that
PuD is an ATTiTUDE, as well as the world's best Underground Newsletter. Names
have been changed slighty to avoid making these people look as stupid as they
really are.

  As you can see, it is quite simple.  A superficial attempt at proverbial
poetic philosophy with references to excretions or food products is all it takes
to really get one of these innocent little modem freaks lost.  If you think you
can play it off, have an entire group of people pull him in to chat on a 4+ node
BBS, and act this way.  Better yet, do it in person, without ever stopping.
This can result in severe nervous dissention as well as a lack of
self-confidence and security for youre idiotic pal.

            Have fun, and shall my stare be the guide to the armadillo's
                     moonlit banquet of Eve and potatoes.

þ PuD VIRII DICUSSION: H0W TO IDENTiFY WARTS  By NO COURiER

  Warts are most basically thickenings of the skin, caused by bacteriophagic
virii.  Warts may be contagious, varying from one to the next.  Most likely, any
warts you have were given to you by somebody else.  Contrary to Old Wive Tales,
warts cannot be spread to a human from a frog or toad.  First and foremost,
toads don't even have warts. That is the way their skin is supposed to be,
stupid.  Secondly, the virii carried by toads are completely incompatible with
a human's potential host cells.  Virii link to a host cell by connecting with a
receptor site.  The way they fit is comparable to as jigsaw puzzle.  An inhuman
virus can not connect with a human cell.  Therefore, it cannot inject its
nucleic acid in order to reprduce.  It is quite common for a wart to have hair
growing out of it. Never treat a wart with an over-the-counter remedy if it has
hair. This should be common sense folks.  I hate life sciences. Physics r000l.
  If a wart changes color, size, itches, etc, have it checked immediately by a
dermotologist.  Don't be an idiot. You could be dead soon.  fReD would like
that, but I wouldn't.
  Be sure that you do not confuse warts with moles.  Moles are most often
pigmented, and may very well have hair growing out of them.  These are simple
normal thickenings of the skin, and should not be taken too seriously.  HOWEVeR,
if you have a mole which changes color, size, or bites at your neck while you
are sleeping, you may have a SEVeRE cancerous condition, such as melonoma, which
can result in death in as little as 72 hours after irritation begins.  Ouch.

  "Dear NO,
     recently I have been doubting my own sexuality.  Sometimes it seems as if
it simply isn't worth it; sex seems to be a farce, a pasaad anymore.  My husband
has never submitted to any of my desires, and I have never orgasmed.
                         What shall I do?"

   Dear Anita,
     shut the fuck up.  If you have never orgasmed, maybe that's why you don't
enjoy sex.  Why don't you go find a real man instead of the pencil-necked Walter

   Dear Candy,
     get a life and stop writing such idiotic letters.  I could care less about

many. Instead, we have found that your column is extremely biased and without
