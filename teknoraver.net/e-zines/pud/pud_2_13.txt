˛ SO what's up with this issue???

	Well I have included some various files related to SBBS 1.17g2. The best
	bbs software there is. Read it and enjoy. I know it's not usual pud fare,
	but then again I haven't been my usual self lately...

˛ What's new in SuperBBS 1.17.

Welcome to SuperBBS 1.17. First of all we would like to appologise for the
delay there was between 1.16 and 1.17. This was not due to any special
reason, more because of more than many reasons <grin>. However, now this
version is released and 1.18 betas will be out pretty soon. This version
doesn't contain so many new features, but please note that all new features
compared to 1.17 gamma-1 have been added in late February 1993.

There are probably a few SysOps who have sent their regs. directly to SBBS
HQ, but haven't received their codes yet. If that's your situation, please
contact us immediately.

Here comes a list of new features compared to SuperBBS 1.16 :

- File flagging has been enchanged

  SuperBBS now creates/reads FileDoor<tm>/EFT<tm>/etc. compatible
  BBSTAGFL.? file (the file is read from/written to the directory of
  current node). There are also some little improvement in file flagging.

- Today / last callers menutype has been enchanged

  SCALLERS.BBS file is no longer used. SBBS now writes CALLERS.BBS instead
  and the format for this file is new (please refer STRUCT.117 for more
  detailed information).

  Two new parameters have been added to menutype 58

  /A displays users alias instead of his/her name.

  /W displays information about what the user did in the BBS.

- Added an option to use own yell tunes for some users/sec. levels

  It's now possible to define specific tunes for some users/security levels
  to a file named YELLTUNE.CTL (stored in the main SBBS directory). The
  format is <NAME/SEC> <TUNE>, for example :

  Aki Antman AKITUNE.CTL
  2500 SEC2500.CTL

- Added an option to edit already posted messages

  A new SysOp option to edit already posted messages has been added. This
  option can be enabled by pressing <E>dit (or whatever it's in your language)
  when reading messages and then number 6. The message can be edited using
  the full screen editor (this is the suggested way) or the built-in line
  editor. Please note that all full screen editors aren't yet able to read
  the old message automaticly to editor. If that's the case with your editor,
  you'll have to quote the original message back to the editor. At least
  GEdit 1.00.05‚ <tm> supports the automatic quote option at the moment.

  When copying a message it's now possible to edit it with the full screen
  editor, too.

- Added support for guest user

  SBBS now supports one "guest user". Guest user means an user who is guest
  in your BBS and probably many different people use that same guest account.

  Creating a guest user is quite simply.

  -Create GUEST.CTL file and add the name of your guest user to the file.
   Only one name is allowed!

  -Logon to BBS as guest and change all informations like password (you'll
   might want to set it empty using ALT-E so no password will be asked from
   guest users), security level etc.

  -Logout

  After that when guest user logons all values are always set to those values
  you have decided. Guests can change any settings they like, but the old
  settings are always restored for the next guest.

  If you want to change an already defined guest profile, just delete
  GUESTU.BBS and GUESTE.BBS files from your main SBBS directory, login as
  guest and change the profile.

- Added an option to select how long FILES.BBS lines are wrapped.

  There is now an option in config to specify to which X position long
  FILES.BBS description lines are wrapped. With this option you can make
  you file lists look a bit nicer.

  When using this option it's suggested to use long line descriptions rather
  than " >" ones.

- Added an option to add download counters automaticly.

  There is now an option in config to add automaticly download counters to
  FILES.BBS when a file is uploaded.

  Please note that this option works only when using long line descriptions!

- Added an option to deny non-ARQ calls

  There is now an option in config to deny all non-ARQ calls (calls without
  error correction). There is also "ARQ string" option in config. To this
  field you'll have to enter the string which your modem returns when an
  ARQ call is detected (ie. /ARQ).

  A new command line parameter has been added to BBS.EXE.

  -A???? species the ARQ connect string (ie. /ARQ) returned by your mailer.
  !!! No spaces are allowed in this string !!!

  A new control code CTRL-K-\ shows whether error correction is enabled
  or not.

- Added an option to use a new user password

  There is now an option in config to specify a new user password. If that
  password is specified in config, a password is automaticly asked from
  new users. If the password given by the user doesn't match, then the
  user is hang-up immediately.

  NUSERPWD.A?? picture (if it's present) is shown to the user before SBBS
  asks for the password.

- Added an option to verify users city at logon

  SuperBBS can now ask ie. "Aki Antman from Helsinki, Finland <Y/n>" after
  user has entered his/her name. If user answers NO he/she can enter his/her
  name again. This option is pretty useful ie. when someone tries to logon to
  BBS and there is already an user with same name in the BBS. This option can
  be enabled/disabled from config and the prompt string is configurable from
  lconfig.

- Added an option to use external chat program

  It's now possible to use external chat program instead of built-in (full)
  screen chat. External chat program option can be enabled by configuring the
  external chat command line to config. If the line has been configured old
  chats can be still used by pressing right shift key when entering chat
  mode.

- Added an option to show RULES.A?? to new users

  SuperBBS can now show RULES.A?? text file to new users configurable number
  of times.

- Added an option to specify min BPS rate for file areas

  There is now a new min. BPS rate field in the file area config. This option
  is pretty useful if you have some file areas which contain ie. big files
  and you don't want users with slow modems to access those areas. This option
  is functional only for template areas!

- Added toggle option to SETFLAG Q-A command

  A toggle option has been added to questionaire command SETFLAG. For example

  SETFLAG D8 TOGGLE

  would toggle the flag D8.

- Added an option to disable users from "users online" list

  By pressing ALT-7 the SysOp can disable the current user from the users
  online list. Please note that this option is valid for current call only!

  Users listed in a new .CTL file HIDETHEM.CTL are always hidden when they
  logon.

- Added new options to "select combined boards" menutype

  Two new commands have been added to menutype 28. Commands like X-Y ON/OFF
  can be used to toggle multiple areas via one command. For example :

  1-35 ON     toggles all boards from 1 to 35 ON
  47-187 OFF  toggles all boards from 47-187 OFF

- <U>pdate user message reading command has been updated

  When using <U>pdate command (or whatever it's in your language) locally
  it's now possible to use SBBSUSER.EXE (must be found from the main SBBS
  path) to edit users information.

- Added view text option to file list more prompt

  It's now possible to view text files while reading file list. The command
  to view text files is same which is used to display archive contest. If
  the file is archive, then archive list is displayed, otherwise the file
  is displayed.

- Random birthday verify has been replaced with verify after # calls

  There is now a new option in config to enable users birthday verification
  after x days. If the check fails once then the check is executed until
  the user is able to enter the correct birthday.

- Added a new auto display file

  It's now possible to view a different .A?? picture for different BPS
  rates. For example B2400.A?? would be displayed to a 2400 BPS caller,
  B14400.A?? would be displayed to 14400 BPS caller etc.

- Added a new auto display file

  A new auto display file SUBWARN.A?? has been added. SUBWARN.A?? is shown
  when the user has under 31 days left until his/her expiration date.

- Added two new control codes

  CTRL-K-= can be used to show current number of tagged files, CTRL-K-?
  can be used to show size of tagged files in bytes.

- SBBS now checks FILES.BBS date before checking the file dates. If FILES.BBS
  date is older than users last date then that FILES.BBS isn't scanned at
  all - this speeds up new files check if there are no new files.

  This option can be enabled/disabled from config.

  Added new FILEDATE option to SBBSUTIL.EXE. This option touches all
  FILES.BBS dates to date of the newest file in area. This option is useful
  when using external programs which touch FILES.BBS date ie. when updating
  it. SuperBBS no longer updates FILES.BBS date when adding download
  counters.

- Added a new .CTL file

  A new .CTL file FILE-OK.CTL has been added. To this file you can list all
  extensions which are allowed in your BBS. Files with extension NOT listed
  in this file will be rejected. The format of FILE-OK.CTL is one extension
  per line, including the point. For example :

  .LZH
  .ARJ
  .ZIP
  .ARC
  .EXE

- Added a new .CTL file

  A new .CTL file NOSOUND.CTL. When user listed in this file tries to page
  the yell sound is not plaid.

- Added a new .CTL file

  A new .CTL file SLOWUSER.CTL has been added. If users name is found from
  this file, he/she is allowed to logon even if his/her BPS rate is slower
  than the minimum BPS rate to logon.

- Menutype 30 has been enchanged

  Menutype 30 (DOS directory) now prompts for path if the data field is
  empty.

- When reading selected messages it's now possible to choose more than one
  selecting criteria.

- SBBS now overwrites the file area name if no files has been found in file
  searches.

- SBBS now correctly reminds you when you are in DOS shell (ALT-J) from
  SBBS.

- Added an option to automaticly delete bad QWK messages by entering 0 to
  the default QWK board setting in config.

- Added an option to use zero padded download counters

- Added an option to display FILEAREA.A?? (if found) instead of the hard
  coded file area list.

- Added an option to disable SBBS from giving back time spent in chat

- Added an option to allow multi word names without allowing one word names.

- Added an option to force new users to use an alias.

- Added an option to use ^C??? color control codes in menu prompts.

- If users name is listed in trashcan.ctl he/she is no longer able to logon
  using alias.

- QWK system now gives some statistics about received messages

- The nodelist browser is now a bit better, for example commands like
  2:220/? work now OK.

- CTRL-B (view an ANSI/ASCII picture) works now in full screen chat, too.

- CTRL-S, CTRL-U and CTRL-T message reading options can now be
  enabled/disabled from config.

- It's no longer possible to copy a password protected file to tempdir
  without entering a correct password.

- /NOEXPIRE parameter is now automaticly added to the default command line
  of SCAN.EXE <tm>.

- Added some new string to LCONFIG, please edit your *.LNG files.

- USERSORT.EXE is now completely rewritten. We decided to include a new
  USERSORT.EXE written by Pasi Talliniemi to SuperBBS package. This new
  USERSORT.EXE should work much better than the ones included in the
  earlier SBBS packages and there are many new sorting options, too.

- STOP.EXE has been updated to read BOARDS.BBS.

- Added security search option to SBBSUSER.EXE.

- It's now possible to read any .ASW file from SBBSUSER.EXE by pressing
  SHIFT-F5.

- A new utility named SNOOPER.COM has been included in this package.
  With SNOOPER.COM and SNETMGR.EXE you are able to monitor/use all remote
  work stations from one computer. To use this new remote maintenance system
  SNOOPER.COM must be loaded on every work station you are going to use with
  SNETMGR.EXE. SNOOPER.COM works only in NETBIOS (tm) environment.
