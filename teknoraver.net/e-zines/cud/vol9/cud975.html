Subject: File 2--&quot;Analysis of Technology in Adult Education&quot; (Excerpt)

((MODERATORS' NOTE:  The following is a brief dissertation
extract on computer mediated learning by Isabelle Sabau.
The complete manuscript, A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED PROBLEMS
IN USES OF TECHNOLOGY IN ADULT EDUCATION is available at:


                          Introduction

       The brink of the 21st century is permeated with giant
  technological advances in the relationship between education and
  communication systems. The dizzying pace of the advances in the
  digital world has resulted in rapid metamorphoses in the
  understanding of such concepts as information, knowledge and
  learning, on one hand, and the methods employed for conveying
  these concepts on the other. The explosion of high tech has
  resulted in the necessity to redefine many of these previously
  familiar ideas. Reliance on technology demands more specialized
  qualifications for working with the increasingly more intricate
  equipment. At the same time, this amplified demand for technical
  knowledge appears to overshadow other areas of both practical
  and philosophical significance. Rapid exchanges of information
  leave little room for analysis and contemplation, thereby
  blurring the distinction between mere data and the further
  reaches of knowledge. This a priori conceptual analysis provides
  a means for a philosophical investigation of knowledge as it
  applies to culture and technology and as these aspects relate to
  distance education. This investigation opens the discussion of
  issues concerning the introduction of technology into the
  educational process. At the same time, the discussion is
  presented as a cautionary tale to raise awareness of the issues
  and suggest further studies.

       Since the accumulation of information has been expanding at
  an exponential rate of growth, its processing and significance
  have become increasingly more difficult for the average person
  to understand. These accelerated developments contribute to the
  ever-widening gap between the mass of information and
  possibilities, on the one hand, and an individual's personal
  opportunity to achieve mastery over the elusive yet increasing
  body of knowledge, on the other.  Commercial advertising entices
  the consumer to purchase various computer programs under the
  promise of one's newly acquired ability to download &quot;knowledge
  into their hard-drives.&quot; Such advertising promises further
  confuse the issue of facts and their meaning.

       In order to make sense of all this progress, knowledge must
  be distinguished from information in kind as well as in degree.
  This investigation will attempt to unravel the distinction
  between information and knowledge in the hope of discovering the
  limitations of technological means of educational delivery. As
  will be shown, knowledge refers to a wider process of
  manipulation of information along with synthesis and analysis.
  Understanding basic principles that govern the underlying
  reality requires more than transmission of data. If this
  definition is correct, then technology may enhance the learning
  and education process, yet it can not relay knowledge.

  The risks inherent in overconfidence in technology may conflate
  the transfer of information and knowledge. The distinction
  between these two concepts refers to information being the
  precept while knowledge provides the concepts and means of
  integrating the data. Technological advances offer a solution
  for dealing with the increasing amount of data and information
  by extending the natural qualities and capacities of the human
  mind. Technology may aid the processing and storage of
  information in a fast and accurate manner, but the sentient
  being manipulating the information is the one that has
  knowledge. Reducing knowledge to just information transfer
  weakens and overly simplifies the idea of education and thereby
  confuses the need for understanding the concepts for the
  manipulation of the information. Thus, on the one hand, new
  information and data grow exponentially, but on the other hand,
  computers and other related tools provide wider and faster
  access and usage of the available data. The power of the
  computer -- especially in the areas of communication and social
  change -- was made acutely poignant by the implementation of
  electronic mail in the White House, and its subsequent press
  release:

       Today we are pleased to announce that for the first time in
       history, the White House will be connected to you via
       electronic mail. Electronic mail will bring the Presidency
       and this Administration closer and make it more accessible
       to the people. (letter from the President and
       Vice-President in announcement of White House electronic
       mail access, June 1, 1993).[1]1

       It would appear that without these high tech advances and
  equipment, human progress in knowledge and understanding of the
  world would be very slow and difficult. The opportunities that
  new technology produces allow for large databases with fast
  cross-references which have hailed the era of global information
  highways and the integration of more diverse ideas.  The same
  forces that propel humans to constant adjustment and change --
  that is, the technology -- also provide the tools for
  re-evaluation and thereby enrich the intellectual relationship
  between individuals and their environments. All these features
  offer the promise of more free flow of information and thereby
  greater interaction among diverse populations and geographical
  spans.

                 Distance learning and education

       Fast-paced modern societies and demands for specialization
  increasingly require more precise skills and abilities on the
  part of individuals. Along with this, there is an increasing
  need for life-long education, since adults must continually
  upgrade their knowledge to meet technologic advances. In other
  words, it appears that on the whole, society itself is becoming
  a complex school, forcing the necessary participation of its
  citizens in the continual up-grading of skills in order for
  these citizens to be able to cope with the ever-changing world.
  The technological changes in turn affect the available body of
  knowledge and its component data bases. Philosophical questions
  arise about the implications of technology in particular dealing
  with education and learning. It is necessary to address the role
  of information and its transference in the learning process and
  the methods whereby information can ultimately become knowledge.

       The processes of education and learning promise the
  delivery of knowledge to students, and technology is seen as a
  possible alternative means of teaching. The question becomes
  whether technology would ultimately enhance education, and how
  best it may be employed in the process. Together, technology and
  its effects on individuals and their understanding of the world,
  produce new ways of formulating knowledge and also new means to
  enable individuals to find meanings amidst the data.  Knowledge
  is to be viewed as the ability to synthesize facts, evidence,
  principles, laws, and logical reasoning. In order for this
  concept of knowledge to be achieved, alternative teaching and
  learning methods must be sought. Is education to be to reduced
  to the manipulation of information, or is the learning process
  more complex relying on discussion and dialogue and thus
  necessitating real time personal contact between the teacher and
  the student?

       Traditional schooling appears inadequate to meet these new
  pressures. This deficiency opens the door for new considerations
  of ways to teach, learn and understand. Time constraints, in
  conjunction with the many roles and expectations that plague
  modern adults, place special demands and strains on traditional
  schooling. This forces learners and educators alike to search
  for alternative teaching and learning methods. Of primary
  importance in formulating such methods is the continuous
  incorporation of the latest studies in neurobiological research,
  psychological testing, memory and intelligence developments. All
  these areas significantly contribute to our understanding of the
  thinking processes of human beings along with sociological and
  cultural studies.  Formulating teaching and learning methods
  that follow the pattern-forming processes of the brain can
  greatly enhance education by emphasizing the understanding and
  synthesis of ideas and their relation to the more complex body
  of knowledge the individual already possesses.

       Among the alternative methods are correspondence and
  evening courses which have a long history, but which are also
  being replaced by newer methods that incorporate audio/visual
  and interactive techniques made possible by the latest
  technological advances.[2]2 One may ask if the introduction and
  emphasis on technology encourages a commercialization of
  knowledge and what the reprecussions of such a view would be.
  There are a number of companies sprouting which, enabled by
  access to the Internet, promise individuals a variety of
  educational activities that claim to produce knowledge. One very
  important point to consider is the role that academic
  institutions play in this process of commecializing education,
  and what can happen to such ideas as standards, quality and
  curricula.

       As electronic and informational technologies proliferate
  and become more readily available, their philosophical
  implications and their subtle influences on the individual need
  to be discussed and evaluated. At present the gap between those
  who have access to technology and those who don't is widening,
  especially the disparities between various countries. The
  analysis of current methodologies for the implementation of
  technologically based alternative methods, employing the
  ever-growing array of technological possibilities should provide
  prescriptions for their improvement as well as uncover their
  inherent limitations. The increasing dependence that modern
  humans exhibit toward the electronic and technological world
  creates different paradigms for defining knowledge and its
  reliance on accumulation of information and data bases.  Does
  increased access to the proliferation of information improve
  knowledge accumulation, and who should be in charge of
  controlling the quality and standards of learning? In other wor
  ds, if education is to be viewed as a business enterprise, can
  anyone become an educational entrepreneur? Does the business
  paradigm threaten the quality of education by placing it at the
  whim of a free market which is based on supply and demand?

       To remain economically viable and progressive and to
  continue to grow in personal terms, individuals today need to
  understand the ubiquitous role technology plays in their lives,
  and especially in their education. This understanding should
  provide a window to the metaphysical world inhabited by modern
  persons and render vague and ambiguous the distinction between
  &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;possibility.&quot; Technology has enabled the creation
  of new worlds -- virtual reality and cyberworlds -- in which
  individuals meet, communicate and interact. These new virtual
  spaces provide different dimensions for dialogue and may become
  increasingly useful in the learning process.  Dialogue provides
  the opportunity for exchange of ideas, but it also emphasizes
  the personal, co-learning dimension that is necessary for a
  deeper understanding of the educational process. Currently,
  video games and other computerized techniques are employed to
  enable individuals more stimulating as well as remedial learning
  environments, especially providing alternatives to cope with
  learning disabilities.[3]3

       In order to maximize the potential of the information
  technology, the ideas concerning learning require a discussion
  that will synthesize philosophical with educational practice and
  theory. Various philosophical questions arise, for example:
  what is knowledge? What is its relationship to data and
  information? Other important questions are: is all knowledge and
  communication to be understood in terms of the transmission of
  digital information? Are there any inherent dangers in such
  overwhelming dependence on electronic media and technology?
  Education has long been understood in terms of providing
  knowledge, but this aspect relies on viewing &quot;knowledge&quot; as a
  process that includes ideas about truth and reality. The
  educational enterprise is deemed responsible for producing
  knowledgeable individuals who are sanctioned by institutions of
  learning with various degrees designed to reflect a standard
  curriculum that aims at integrating the individual into the
  larger society. The curriculum emphasizes skills and knowledge
  about the self and the world at large. The degrees conveyed by
  various institutions relfect the standards society deems
  necessary in order to recognize an individual's accumulated
  knowledge. What is the process by which persons begin to
  integrate relevant information into the complexity that becomes
  an &quot;educated&quot; citizen? The metamorphosis of information, data
  and understanding into knowledge needs to be analyzed to reveal
  the role of technologically based processes of learning in the
  educational enterprise. To this extent, this investigation is a
  conceptual exploration of these ideas.

       One important cornerstone of American democracy is public
  education, which was designed to ensure the thoughtful exercise
  of civic duty within the community and the voting booth. In the
  words of George Washington, the First President of the United
  States: &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to
  good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the
  means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot;[4]4 Yet, our
  rapidly changing world demands scrutiny and continuous
  re-evaluation of the concept and processes of education, of the
  assumption of the purposes of education and the end products
  education is thought to produce. This discussion will juxtapose
  theory and application in an attempt to synthesize them. The
  philosophical framework of semiotics will inform this work for
  conceptual as well as practical analysis.

The Vacuity of Information
 -------------------------

According to David Shenk, author of *Data Smog: Surviving the Information
Glut*,

   For many businesses, the irony is that the cheaper information becomes,
   the more expensive it is to deal with.

Yes, although I'm not so sure about the irony.  If &quot;information&quot; is
precisely articulable, if it is measurable as so many bits stored in a
database, if it is easily transmissible -- in other words, if it fits the
criteria for information according to the prevalent rhetoric -- then it
follows in a straightforward way that any preoccupation with information
will penalize our pursuit of whatever is important.

Why?  Because the precision, the measurability, and the transmissibility
all stand in a kind of opposition to depth of meaning and significance.
This trade-off is clearly demonstrable through an examination of the basic
act of communication (see, for example, my discussion in
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/people/staff/stevet/fdnc/ch23.html">http://www.oreilly.com/people/staff/stevet/fdnc/ch23.html</a>), yet it remains
the great, ignored truth at the heart of the Information Age.  We have, of
course, almost made a cliche of the slogan, &quot;information is not wisdom.&quot;
But until we vividly recognize the actual *opposition* between the two
terms -- and learn to live creatively within this opposition -- the effort
to reconceive society in terms of information and its flows will prove
extremely corrosive of everything that matters.

*** New Discussion Forum on the Internet
   to debate specific issues of the European Commission_s=20
    Green Paper on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity
    in Audiovisual and Information Services ***

Following its Green Paper on the Protection of Minors and Human
Dignity in Audiovisual and Information services and the first
conclusions presented in a European Commission staff working paper,
the Commission services are currently drafting a Communication and
draft project for a Council Recommendation on this subject.

In order to enrich and update the Commission services' information on
the relevant topics and to encourage the networking of organisations
and individuals actively working on measures to ensure the protection
of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services,
the European Commission has opened a Discussion Forum which discusses
four specific issues:

- Labelling, rating and filtering systems on the Internet;
- Raising awareness and education of Internet users;
- Promoting quality content for children on the Internet;
- Monitoring and evaluation of relevant policies and initiatives.

The Commission would appreciate very much if you could contribute with
your expertise to one or more of these topics.  Please feel also free
to forward this message to persons and/or organisations which you
think could be interested in contributing to the debate.

             Education and the Net -- Read and Weep
             --------------------------------------

Writing in *Business Week* (July 28), a fourth-grade teacher describes her
truly heroic efforts to get her students on the Net in the interest of
bringing science alive for them.  Her selfless energy and devotion is
matched only by the pitiful insignificance of the treasure the educational
establishment has inspired her to seek.  Here is one of her anecdotes:

   Fourth-graders solicited questions from students and submitted them to
   researchers at Georgia Tech.  My students retrieved the answers and
   aired them over the school's closed-circuit TV system.

And a second one:

   At a planetarium, Megan, one of my girls, interrupted the talk on
   downloading images to ask:  &quot;Is that ProComm Plus you are using?&quot;  When
   the surprised speaker answered &quot;yes,&quot; Megan said, &quot;I use that at
   school.&quot; He invited her to demonstrate, and Megan easily downloaded an
   image from a remote observatory.  I was so proud.

Almost makes you forget that there's a real world out there for
healthy young children to explore.

Actually, the teacher does mention in passing a couple of direct
learning activities her students engaged in.  But these turn out
to have nothing to do with the computer.

*Business Week* subtitled the article, &quot;A Georgia teacher tells
how she got her students on the Web -- and wild about science.&quot;
Nothing in the article verifies the &quot;wild about science&quot; part,
but presumably the children had as much fun playing with their
new toys as many grown-ups do.

A three day conference hosted by the Institute for Learning
and Research Technology at the University of Bristol.

The first international IRISS conference aims to bring
together social scentists who are interested in the
Internet, either as a means of supporting and
enhancing their work, or as a focus for their research.

***CONFERENCE THEMES***

The themes of this year's conference are Internet skills, sites and
social effects.  The conference aims to reflect the practical and
theoretical questions raised by the increasing role of networked
information in the social sciences and society. Topics for debate
include:

* how can social scientists make effective use of the
Internet in their work?
* where and how are social scientists using the Internet
to enhance their work and what effect is it having on
traditional roles and working methods?
* what high quality information can the Internet supply to
social scientists?
* what impact does the Internet have on individuals and
society and what visions do we have for the future?

***ATTENDING IRISS AS A DELEGATE***

This is the first call for delegates for IRISS. Confirmed, to date,
for the conference are:

* several high-profile keynote speakers
* a large variety of papers and presentations, covering all of the
conference themes, and presented by speakers from a combination of
academic, commercial, public and social/voluntary organisations
* pre and during conference hands-on workshops, in fully networked
rooms and conducted by experienced Internet for Social Scientist
trainers
* the main conference dinner, held in the prestigious Harveys
Restaurant and Museum - see:
<a href="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/iriss/harveys.html">http://www.sosig.ac.uk/iriss/harveys.html</a>

Bristol is a city in the west of England; it is served by an
international airport, located 11 miles south of the city. The city has
two major train stations, with frequent train services to London (in
under 2 hours) and other cities. South Wales is a few minutes away by
train or car, and the scenic areas of the Cotswolds, Cornwall and Devon
are all easily accessible, as are attractions such as the city of Bath,
Stonehenge and Avebury.

Bristol itself is a thriving cosmopolitan city, with a very lively
social and cultural scene. The city has many famous sites of
interest, such as the Clifton suspension bridge and the S.S. Great
Britain, which are within a short distance of the conference location
and accomodation. Various on-line guides to Bristol include:

Subject: File 8--Review of &quot;Net Lessons: Net-based Projects for your Classroom&quot;

Review of:  NET LESSONS: WEB-BASED PROJECTS FOR YOUR CLASSROOM.
By Laura Parker Roerden. 1997. Sebastopol (Calif): O'Reilly.
284 pp. $24.95 (paper).

The question is no longer whether Web-based pedagogy will have an
impact on education. The question is how much, how fast, and how
far.  NET LESSONS will benefit especially those teachers who are
not yet comfortable with the Web, and who remain unsure of how to
integrate Web and Internet exercises into their classes or
curriculum. Although written primarily for primary and secondary
(K-12) instructors, Roerden identifies some basic strategies for
a Web-integrated curriculum that can be upgraded fairly easily
for post-secondary classes.

Roerden begins with the most basic question: Why should any
instructor bother learning about the Web?  Then, like a patient
teacher, she explains the rationale and identifies the resources
available for students and teachers.

Chapter 2, &quot;Designing your Curriculum,&quot; provides a dozen
activities that can be developed by instructors at any level.  In
addition to the obvious tasks of using the Web as a resource and
for communication, she lists a few narrower uses, including
mentoring, social interaction, simulation, surveys, and Web
publishing. The remainder of the book describes how the dozen
activities can be integrated into substantive courses, such as
math, social studies, language, science, and art. Each chapter
contains a well-defined series of exercises for various grade
levels, but the excericises can be modified to fit college
courses as well.

Although the sample activities in the chapters were submitted by
the individual instructors who created them, they possess
remarkable consistency in quality, format, and substance. Each
exercise specifies a project's timeline, objectives,
prerequisites, and procedures.  Some excericises are designed for
individual students and others for students working in groups.
All can be modified as needed for content, work load, and grade
level.  Three appendixes include a Net lesson index, sample
worksheets, and a list of useful URLs pointing to curriculum
resources and teaching strategies.

Although minor quibbles, there are few details that the author
might correct in future editions. First, Roerden uses the term
&quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;Web&quot; interchangeably. This inaccuracy is
especially ironic in a volume attempting to introduce youth to
Cyberspace. This faux pas should be corrected. Second, the net is
not as race/sex/culture blind as the author claims. Differences
in backgrounds and biographies shape facility and comfort with
Net interaction.  Given the diversity of abilities and
personalities, a volume such as this would benefit from including
a chapter or two on breaking down differences amongst students.
Third, the volume should include a chapter or two on CGI scripts
that enhance the exercises. Fourth, the omission of synchronous
interactive exercises using discussion groups and software such
as Engaged to communicate with others was disappointing.  Fifth,
given the emerging PC-based audio-visual technology, a future
edition should address the potential of web-based synchronous and
asynchronous A/V classroom activities.

A final criticism focuses on O'Reilly's odd tendency to include
supplemental CDROM disks in their works. This volume might seem
an exception were it not that the disk O'Reilly provides is AOL
3.0. When the book jacket indicates CD-ROM included, I felt as
though I were the victim of a practical joke when I found the
same disk that AOL has sent me at least a half-dozen times in the
past year. The blatant hucksterism of this misleading promo
detracts from the credibility not only of the book, but also from
O'Reilly. One expect a bit more from them.
