 ≥      This is the eleventh issue of Reality Check Network.  By this time,   ≥

 ≥      This issue of RCN new features some "fun stuff" to do when you're     ≥
 ≥  bored.  Rebel Chicken and I got bored (again) of the same-old same-old    ≥
 ≥  mag, and we fealt that just editorials (of which we have gotten a record  ≥
 ≥  number this week) isn't enough interaction between our readers and us.    ≥
 ≥  New in this issue, you will find a "Warez-IQ" questionnaire of some       ≥
 ≥  trivia questions about the scene today.  You will also find a voting      ≥

 €      Reality is a really awesome coding group.  They are not at all into   €
 €  warez, so don't go looking for them on IRC.  I suggest you look for       €
 €  some of their demos on a demos site, and maybe you'll find some of their  €
 €  coding work.  As far as composing, any music they make, you'll find in    €

 €      Hi!  First, congrats for your excellent e-mag!  Definitely the best!  €
 €  I have a suggestion, though.  Please put an option that will              €
 €  automatically change the music sequentially, cause you get bored reading  €
 €  the huge mag with the same music, and it's hard to go back to change the  €
 €  music.                                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Dear Reader,                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Great idea!  We, the editors, probably don't notice the problem as    €
 €  much because most of the time we're reading the mag, we're in AcidDraw    €
 €  writing or proofreading, not actually running the EXE.  We'll try to      €
 €  implement the idea as soon as possible!                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Note : NEW, and IMPROVED!  We have now implemented this idea, so you'll   €
 €         probably notice the music changing any minute now.                 €
 €                                                                            €

 €  Dear RCN,                                                                 €

 €      I can not understand why many groups in the scene hate each other     €
 €  based on the fact that they are competing against each other or because   €
 €  of accidental dupes.  The way I see it, we are all in this together and   €
 €  despite how lame this sounds, we should stand united and with united      €
 €  roots we won't be overcome.  How do you people at RCN feel on this?       €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Dear Reader,                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      If you're waiting for all the groups to unite, you've got a long      €
 €  wait ahead of you.  I don't argue that there should be separate groups    €
 €  because some people just don't get along with others.  I do argue,        €
 €  however, that we would be better off with just one big group, or          €
 €  "united" as you put it.  Competition is what makes the scene have         €
 €  quality releases.  At times, one's competitive spirit will overcome him   €
 €  and cause him to fuck up on releases, but that's besides the point.  If   €
 €  the scene weren't based on competition, why would we have it?  Surely     €
 €  you don't think that we actually USE any of the software we release,      €
 €  right?!                                                                   €

 €      I would like to say something to all sysops out there.  If you        €
 €  haven't read about the bust of the Assasin's Guild for having Novell and  €
 €  Microsoft software online, go read it.  I have been a sysop for 6 years   €
 €  now and in my area code we have had a few BBSs busted just for Novell     €
 €  files being online.  No one chases their files down like Novell does,     €
 €  consider this just as a warning and say it is bullshit if you want, BUT,  €
 €  I have seen what the cops do to a house when they search it, and I have   €
 €  seen friends lose all of their computer equipment just over Novell.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Dear Reader,                                                              €

 €      You are exactly right.  Let us all take the bust of the Assasin's     €
 €  Guild as a warning.  It's not hard to dodge the cops, but not following   €
 €  rules just because we think they're stupid isn't going to get us too far  €
 €  in the scene.                                                             €

 €      This is a response to the articles about tKLP and RoR, and their      €
 €  involvement with Legacy and NFS.  First, on the topic of tKLP sabotaging  €
 €  NFS, the only one who sabotaged NFS was the dumbass who released          €
 €  Softram 96 because they were told by tKLP to hurry and beat his group.    €
 €  Competing groups have never, to my knowledge, told another group to       €
 €  hurry so that they could beat their own group.  On the subject of tKLP    €
 €  'stealing' members, according to the article written by Akira 7, it       €
 €  didn't appear to me that he was asking him to leave LGC for RoR.  He      €
 €  could very easily have been in both groups, believe me, I am.  Now onto   €
 €  the wars between LGC and tKLP and other RoR members.  Why not just let    €
 €  it die?   I am pretty sure I speak for most people when I say ENOUGH IS   €
 €  ENOUGH, we are getting tired of reading and hearing about it.  The lame   €
 €  channel takeover attempts, the LGC SUCKS DICK, ROR SUCKS DICK.  It is     €
 €  all childish, instead of wasting your time bashing the other people,      €
 €  why not do something productive, spread some warez, make some money, get  €
 €  laid, whatever, just quit the wars.                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Dear Reader,                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I will agree with you that Akira 7 could have very well been in both  €
 €  RoR and LGC, and maybe the article didn't do a very good job of           €
 €  clarifying it, but tKLP has continuously harassed my members trying to    €
 €  either get them to join RoR or do other little favors for him.  We are    €
 €  not in a war with RoR, a war involves interaction of two sides.  It       €
 €  happened to be that                                                       €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €  The following is in response to the courier group ranking of RCN issue    €
 €  10...                                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      When couriering first started in the scene, it wasn't about editing   €
 €  file_id.diz's.  It wasn't about offering in channels.  It was about       €
 €  competing with your competitors on the boards.  Anyone can edit a DIZ,    €
 €  anyone can type /plist, but not everyone can get warez fast enough to     €
 €  upload them to the biggest boards.  You rated RTS as #1.  In this, I      €
 €  totally disagree.  RTS is a very respectable group, and I myself am       €
 €  friends with good old Ordnance, but they are clearly not #1.  RiSC is at  €
 €  the top.  They have a hidden channel on IRC so lamers don't try to get    €
 €  in #RiSC, bug people, etc.  Only the leetest people know what channel     €
 €  RiSC is in, and yes, they do have sites, and they are not public or       €
 €  anonymous sites, they're the way it should be.  They are private sites,   €
 €  therefore you have to be in RiSC or be very respected to be on them.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Warez should go to people who make the scene run, not lamers who      €
 €  beg.  Knowing Park Central is their WHQ, and the best board in the world  €
 €  statistically and popularity-wise, each week the top 10 uploaders are     €
 €  from RiSC.  This is what couriering is about, it's about racing and       €
 €  competition and having fun while doing it.  They have the best couriers   €
 €  in the business.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      In second place, I believe, is MALiCE.  They do some offering on the  €
 €  net, but they are strong BBS couriers like RiSC as well.  Call the top    €
 €  boards, MALiCE people will be on the top 10 as well.  In third place      €
 €  should be RTS, they are strong in both areas, but not superb in BBS       €
 €  couriering like RiSC and MALiCE.  These are just the corrections I would  €
 €  like to submit that I feel need to be changed.                            €

 €      First off, I would like to submit corrections to your editorial.      €
 €  What you sent in is not a correction to Trite's writeup, it's not a fix,  €
 €  it's your opinion, an opinion that I, along with many others, value.  I   €
 €  happen to value Trite's opinion as well.  I'm glad that you backed up     €
 €  your opinions with facts, they are all quite true, you have a nice        €
 €  perspective on the couriering scene.  Keep reading this issue of RCN,     €
 €  Trite has modified his writeup (no, he didn't change any of the final     €
 €  scores!) so that he is better backing up his previous opinions.  Enjoy,   €
 €  and write in again if you still disagree with his results!                €

 €      Last week in RCN, I read a letter from a reader saying Windows 95     €
 €  is shit.  Five months ago I would have agreed.  First off, my system is   €
 €  a Pentium-90 with 16 megs of RAM.  When I first tried WIndows 95 I was    €
 €  running OS/2 with spuratic trap 0002 crashes.  My BBS ran GREAT under     €
 €  it, and it was a powerful operating system.  Then I wanted to get more    €
 €  into the net, and using OS/2 on the net is a waste.  OS/2 was great but   €
 €  has shit for support.  Soooo, after being an OS/2 diehard and saying      €
 €  Windows 95 is a piece of shit for so long I finally had to make the       €
 €  jump.                                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Okay, format the drives, install Windows 95 (30 minutes of hell).     €
 €  OK, it starts right up!  Seems okay at first, I am a little lost, how do  €
 €  I add DOS programs?  How do I edit pifs?  ARGH!!  I fuck with it for      €
 €  about 3 hours, won't run my CAD program without a reboot, BBS runs like   €
 €  shit if I multitask, FUCK THIS!  Reformat, reinstall OS/2...  That was    €
 €  my first impression of the wonderful world of "Wild" Bill Gates.  About   €
 €  a month later the hatred diminished a tad.  Okay, give it another shot.   €
 €  Format the drives, reinstall, first night, sucked, second night, hmm,     €
 €  found some cool shit.  After running for four months.. I love it!  Now    €
 €  I have no problem running ANYTHING I want, Hexen and Doom II run great,   €
 €  my CAD runs great!  When I am on the net now, I just keep opening         €
 €  windows without a worry.  I usually have MiRC, 2 CuteFTPs, Eudora,        €
 €  MS-DOS prompt, Iparty (which is voice talking to multiple friends at      €
 €  once, and it works, not like IPhone) and moving around in all these       €
 €  windows is not a problem.  It may not have the absolute power of Linux,   €
 €  but I also have a shitload of new apps to try out each week, and tons of  €
 €  help if I have problems.  Plus, it looks pretty!  So, for anyone who      €

 €      It's funny, I had the exact same story coming from OS/2.  OS/2 was    €
 €  a real dream come true coming from Windows 3.1, even on my 486/66 with    €
 €  a mere 8 megs of RAM!  Heck, at least I could download in the             €
 €  background!  Windows 95 really is the better choice now, though.  More    €
 €  software is available for it, and it doesn't swap nearly as much.         €

 €   Q  : In last week's issue of RCN, you submitted an article accusing      €
 €        tKLP of asking you to join RoR.  When he asked you to join, did he  €
 €        at any point, ask you to leave Legacy for RoR?  If so, what were    €
 €        tactics did he use?                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, tKLP asked me to leave Legacy.  He "swore" that Legacy was     €
 €        going to die that night, and that I shouldn't waste my time with a  €
 €        dying group.  He then proceded to ask me to leave Legacy in order   €
 €        to join RoR.                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : On what basis could he "swear" that Legacy would die that very      €
 €        night?                                                              €

 €   A  : tKLP said that his friends from Hybrid and D0D would come and help  €
 €        him permanently break up Legacy.                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How was tKLP and his friends planning to permanently break down     €
 €        Legacy?  What was tKLP's plan?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : tKLP said that he would, along with his friends, take down #Legacy  €
 €        permanently.  He also said that they would follow Legacy to         €
 €        whatever new channel we came up with.  tKLP also said he was going  €
 €        to convince key members to switch groups.  This was all part of     €
 €        tKLP's plan to "kill Legacy."                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why did you not believe tKLP?  What stopped you from leaving a      €
 €        "dying group"?                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I thought it was possible that the three groups would try to take   €
 €        down Legacy, but I knew it was not going to be successful.  I have  €
 €        been a member of FSW, Vendetta, and then Legacy, and Legacy is      €
 €        here to stay.  If Legacy did die, and I were to join another group  €
 €        it would not be RoR.                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What would turn you off from joining RoR?                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : The main turn off from RoR is their leadership.  I have absolutely  €
 €        NO respect for tKLP as a leader.                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why do you not trust the leadership of RoR when it is someone as    €
 €        well respected as tKLP?                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I would not call tKLP "well respected."  He is one of the worst     €
 €        leaders I have ever met.  He has been kicked out of his own group,  €
 €        and is constantly trying to steal suppliers from other groups.  He  €
 €        does not care about his group or his members, and he has no style.  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : When tKLP asked you to leave Legacy to join RoR, and you simply     €
 €        said "No", what was his response?                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : tKLP said, "Hey man, if you want to ride into the ground with       €
 €        Legacy, don't blame me."  He then asked me to consider joining RoR  €
 €        after Legacy died.  tKLP has asked me to leave Legacy for RoR many  €
 €        times even though I keep saying "No."  He is definitely persistent. €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I was sitting on IRC one night thinking about how I wasn't really   €
 €        giving 100% to my other duties, mainly TSC (The Sixthed Circle).    €
 €        I have decided to devote more time to my utilities group by         €
 €        leaving MindCrash for now.  It takes too much work to do a good     €
 €        job and it wouldn't be fair for MindCrash if I only half-tried.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : If TSC doesn't work out, will you go back to MindCrash?             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, I have made my bed already and I will lay in it.  I can't go    €
 €        back 3 months from now and ask to be a senior again, that would be  €
 €        a bad thing.  I made it clear that I have nothing against anyone    €
 €        in MindCrash.  The Wicked One and Blitzkrieg stood by me until      €
 €        the end.  I am sure that MC will continue to be one of the best     €
 €        courier groups in the world, doing what they do best, couriering.   €
 €        I will miss MC a lot because they are a tight band of couriers.  I  €
 €        have much respect for The Wicked One and Blitzkrieg.  I have been   €
 €        in MindCrash since the very start and I will sincerely miss MC.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will keep TSC from dying like a lot of other new utility       €
 €        release groups?                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : With my current resources, and with proper management, TSC should   €
 €        do just fine.  I'm not going to lie, it is hard to start a release  €
 €        group nowadays because there are so many of them out there.  TSC    €
 €        isn't formed on the premise of ruling the scene.  We only want to   €
 €        do our part  to help.  We have a positive attitude when working     €
 €        with bigger groups, which is always a big plus.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are the policies of TSC?  Will TSC members be allowed to join  €
 €        other utility release groups?                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : That varies a lot since it varies with each person and how much     €
 €        they contribute to TSC.  I don't really have a problem with it if   €
 €        the person is dedicated 100% to TSC and can do other shit as well   €
 €        for other groups.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Many TSC members are also in MC, it must be very beneficial for     €
 €        TSC to be affiliated with such a strong courier group.  Is TSC and  €
 €        MC officially sister groups?                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, TSC and MC are sister groups.                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : TSC has had a few releases so far, how has it been working out?     €

 €   A  : Releasing is going great, our suppliers have done well so far, and  €
 €        MC has done a great job spreading our files.                        €

 €   A  : We will being doing utilities for now since they are my favorite.   €
 €        Great games come and go, but a great utilities stick around my HD   €
 €        longer.                                                             €

 €   Q  : Do you feel that TSC will grow in numbers as well as in release     €
 €        power?                                                              €

 €   A  : I would rather keep the numbers within the group small.  I know     €
 €        everyone in the group right now, so we have less conflicts.  If we  €
 €        do expand our operations, then that would be fine as well since it  €
 €        is all part of doing business.  We will survive as long as we keep  €
 €        up our standards.                                                   €

 €   Q  : Legacy is a fast-growing games group and is now considered one of   €
 €        the top 3.  Why do you feel that Legacy has risen to such           €
 €        greatness in such a short period of time?                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Legacy is like the "Third Reich" for Rebel Chicken and myself.  We  €
 €        started out with FSW, and boy was that a disaster, a disaster to    €
 €        the rest of the scene, though.  In reality, it was the place where  €
 €        Rebel Chicken and I learned what to do in a group, or, more         €
 €        specifically what NOT to do.  It was amazing, we were twisted from  €
 €        the start.  Even the name was retarded.  After FSW, we started      €
 €        Vendetta.  Vendetta was much more organized, did a much better job  €
 €        of releasing quality, not just anything we found in a gutter, it    €
 €        didn't just use the word of others when it came to dupe checking,   €
 €        and our members were much more dedicated.  The group came down      €
 €        rather abruptly, though, when school started, and we thoguth we'd   €
 €        be overwhelmed with work (we were wrong).  We missed the scene too  €
 €        much, and just as soon as we left, we were back in it, this time    €
 €        with a plan, yes, another one.  So far, that plan has worked.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Since Legacy is an improvement upon two younger and less            €
 €        experienced, do you feel that many of the smaller groups today      €
 €        will somehow die and come back in the future as a more significant  €
 €        team?                                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : That's part of the reason why I always treat young groups with      €
 €        respect.  I said this in the last issue of RCN, and I guess I'll    €
 €        say it again.  It takes ambition to start a new group, and all      €
 €        group leaders should be credited for being courageous enough to     €
 €        join the competition.  If a group breaks down because the faculty   €
 €        isn't dedicated enough, that's one thing.  If a group breaks down   €
 €        because its methods are not right, that's another thing.  The       €
 €        latter is a perfectly good example of someone striving for a        €
 €        second chance, and that's the beauty of the scene.  You can always  €
 €        have another chance.  I wouldn't expect every small group that      €
 €        comes up and then dies to become the next great, but I'm sure that  €
 €        a small percentage of the groups will, and we should recognize the  €
 €        groups for that small percent.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Legacy has released a lot of software that would be considered      €
 €        "Budget."  Are these programs as inexpensive as people claim, and   €
 €        if so, will that stop you from releasing them?                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Legacy started because the two groups that preceded it had too      €
 €        many broken releases, either not properly cracked or just not well  €
 €        packaged.  We have dedicated ourselves to releasing quality games   €
 €        that people will want.  Our main serious fuckup to date was that    €
 €        game called "Bass Fishing Classics."  It was a store release, but   €
 €        that in no way justified its release.  If any game that Legacy has  €
 €        released was budget, that was it!  Apart from that, we are looking  €
 €        for quality.  I was recently criticized on IRC about a release we   €
 €        did a few days back, "Pinball 4000."  The person was trying to      €
 €        tell me that the game sold for a mere $14.99, a "budget" program    €
 €        that should not have been released.  That seemed preposterous to    €
 €        me.  I don't download many games, but I did download this game due  €
 €        to its size (1 disk!) and was quite pleased with the result.  A     €
 €        seven minute download and I got a very nice game!  Money doesn't    €
 €        tie into the scene, we download programs free of charge, and we     €
 €        have no right to bash on a program when it wasn't a $69.95 game.    €
 €        Legacy is used to releasing those types of games, but you must      €
 €        note of the time, it's January, and not that many companies are     €
 €        publishing new software.  Instead of expecting $70 games, Legacy    €
 €        looks for games that may have been missed, or games that never      €
 €        made it out because the crack was too hard.  While sifting through  €
 €        the programs, we often find these smaller games that could be very  €
 €        nice releases.  Pinball 4000 was one of them (Bass Fishing          €
 €        Classics was not :-).                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Legacy has released many games that have worked perfectly.          €
 €        However, releases such as "Prisoner of Ice" have managed to seep    €
 €        through.  What do you do when you release a program that is not     €
 €        fully functioning?                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Prisoner of Ice was our first release, and we were not as           €
 €        experienced in releasing games only as we now are.  What do we do   €
 €        when such a program is released?  Hehehe, well, I usually just      €
 €        blame it on Rebel Chicken!  Heheh, after that, though, I, along     €
 €        with the rest of the Legacy staff, will do my best to help the      €
 €        user get the game to work, even if the problem directly involves    €
 €        his computer.  We are here to get our programs to work on our       €
 €        end users' computers.  If that involves helping them install a      €
 €        program that has nothing to do with ours, so be it.                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Legacy is well known for having one of the most user-friendly       €
 €        installers for all their games.  Many people have grown used to     €
 €        merely typing LGC-INST.  Do you feel that it is becoming a          €
 €        necessity in the scene to have an installer?                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I think it's more important for a games group to have an installer  €
 €        than for a utils group to have one.  It is virtually unheard of to  €
 €        release a disk game, and CD games are no longer as easy to install  €
 €        as the old disk games were.  We now use multi-volume ARJ files and  €
 €        subdirectories and aah!  By the time you have typed all the         €
 €        required parameters for ARJ, you've forgotten what the release      €
 €        was!  With utils, this isn't so much a problem because most utils   €
 €        do come on disks.  Also, a games group is there to provide          €
 €        entertainment, and it is in synch with the mood of our releases to  €
 €        have a fun looking EXE to present to our users.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why did Legacy pick MindCrash as their official couriers?           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Being a games group, Legacy gets its releases couriered no matter   €
 €        what.  Our problem isn't in finding people to get our releases      €
 €        out, it's in finding a couriering force that will be dedicated to   €
 €        us when one of our members needs a release or what not.  It just    €
 €        happens to be that MindCrash is an awesome couriering force, both   €
 €        dedication-wise and speed-wise.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why doesn't Legacy release utils?                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We believe that we can stay much more on task if we concentrate     €
 €        on one type of program.  We have enough experience and have tried   €
 €        the other ways we thought might work, and this one seems to be the  €
 €        best so far.  Ripping and cracking games isn't easy, and having to  €
 €        concentrate both on that and on utils would be a bit overwhelming.  €
 €        When we do get utils, however, we give them to our sister group,    €
 €        Mayhem, as they give us their games when they have them.            €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : MOTiV8 has long been famous for its awesome sites.  How important   €
 €        are private sites for MOTiV8?                                       €

 €   A  : Private sites are very important for the group.  Without private    €
 €        sites we wouldn't have steady places to leech from.                 €
 €                                                                            €

 €   A  : We are not currently supporting anonymous sites, but once we are    €
 €        organized and get all our private sites back up, I want to start    €
 €        doing anonymous sites again because it helps spread files to the    €

 €        with ease.  I make sure that the sites are being supported.  If     €

 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We aren't concentrating on BBS couriering too much right now, but   €
 €        we might in the future.  However, we do have a few BBS couriers.    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : I have great respect for MOTiV8 and tend to give it the benefit of  €
 €        the doubt, but how much does MOTiV8 concentrate on Net IRC          €
 €        spreading.  It is a rare moment when I see a MOTiV8 courier either  €
 €        Legacy releases or any other releases.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Unfortunately, not too much at the moment but since our private     €
 €        sites are back up, we can grab releases a lot easier and you might  €
 €        see us spreading a lot on IRC.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Althought I doubt it is true, because I know that MOTiV8 has many   €
 €        dedicated members, but is MOTiV8 going through a low point right    €
 €        now?                                                                €

 €   Q  : What is Rush?  Does Rush specialize in games or utilities, if it    €
 €        does not yet specialize in an area, will it do so in the near       €
 €        future?                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Rush currently specializes in both games and utilities, but I       €
 €        think we will let other groups take care of games.                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why will Rush specialize in utilities?  What are the advantages of  €
 €        specializing in utilities and not in games?                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have many good games connections, but many Rush members feel     €
 €        that the "scene" is getting closer.  We feel that the utilities     €
 €        scene comes closer to "the heart" more than the game scene does.    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : In what way is the utilities scene "closer to the heart"?  Is Rush  €
 €        specializing in utilities because it is easier to find a utility    €
 €        to release than it is to find a game to release?                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Rush started as doing utilities only, but then we thought about     €
 €        releasing games.  For most of us, we feel that it is more fun to    €
 €        release utilities than it is to release games.                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : More fun?  One can play a game, but one cannot play a utilitiy.     €
 €        Why would releasing something that cannot be played be more fun     €
 €        than releasing something that one can play?                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Releasing utilities is more fun than releasing games.  I am not     €
 €        talking for everyone in Rush because I never play games.  Rush can  €
 €        help more people by releasing utilities.                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What sets Rush apart from other release groups?                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Our crew works very hard and we have great relationships with our   €
 €        suppliers.  We are only trying to support "the scene" with some     €
 €        good titles.                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are some of the good titles recently from Rush?                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I heard rumors that SoftIce for Win95 was a dupe, others say that   €
 €        it wasn't, but I really liked that release.                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Yes, it was a dupe of a release from Hemp from mid 1995.  What      €
 €        will Rush do in order to prevent future dupes?                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We dupe check our releases on boards like Beyond Akira and then we  €
 €        check with couriering groups on IRC.  We check a release around     €
 €        5-6 times before releasing it.  From this year on, we will never    €
 €        dupe because there is no reason to.                                 €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : Why was Sindicate started?  According to my sources, SNC is a       €
 €        branch of another new group, NFS (Need for Speed).  Is that true,   €
 €        if so, why did SNC branch off?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : SNC is not a branch off of NFS.  SNC was started for the fun of     €
 €        releasing warez and getting them out to the people.  We do have     €
 €        many NFS members in our group but we are not a branch off.  NFS     €
 €        has been talking to another founder about a possible merge.         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Is it not true that many SNC seniors were once NFS seniors?  Does   €
 €        that not prove that they left NFS to join SNC?                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : NFS did not like us when we first started off because many NFS      €
 €        members decided to join SNC.  Fallout kicked out everyone from NFS  €
 €        that was also in SNC.  We have two SNC seniors that were kicked     €
 €        out of NFS because Fallout believed that they were not loyal.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : According to Darkrage, another senior of SNC, 3 suppliers left NFS  €
 €        to join SNC, is that statement true?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, I am not sure on the exact number, but it was around 3.        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will make SNC bigger and better than NFS and other release     €
 €        groups?                                                             €

 €   A  : We are a very organized group and I beleive the senior council      €
 €        knows how to run a group successfully.  Our objective is to get     €
 €        warez out as fast as we can.                                        €

 €   Q  : Will SNC specialize in a specific area of releasing in the near     €
 €        future?                                                             €

 €   A  : We are currently a group that only releases utilities.              €
 €                                                                            €

 €   A  : I personally like NFS and I think it can be a very successful if    €
 €        the council does not fuck up.  Fallout and I are friends and I      €
 €        like him.                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : You were the President of NBC before it died, will SNC be another   €
 €        repeat of NBC?  Will it die in a week?                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, I was the President of NBC.  I do not think that we will die.  €
 €        NBC was very unorganized and we made some bad mistakes at the very  €
 €        start, and that will not happen again.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What were some of those bad choices, and how will you prevent them  €
 €        from happening again?                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We basically let in everyone that applied and we never checked      €
 €        references.  I will make sure to check references from now on.      €
 €                                                                            €

 €   A  : We would make new applicants give 3 or 4 references and we would    €
 €        talk to them.  We would then put the new applicant on trial to see  €
 €        if he can release like he said he can.  If they meet the deadline,  €
 €        then we would consider them to be a full member.                    €

 €                                                                            €
 €  The following is an open letter (Submitted to RCN for publication) to     €
 €  all in the scene:                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Though many of you probably don't know me, I am writing this letter   €
 €  to all so that you may know the error of my ways, and so that you won't   €
 €  repeat any of my mistakes.                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      For six months, I was a part of fATE.  I was the SiteOp of their Net  €
 €  WHQ.  My FTP site logged more than 1.8 terabytes of transfers during      €
 €  my tenure as a fATE operative, and more than 30 gigs of warez were        €
 €  pumped into the scene because of it.  By most accounts, including those   €
 €  of g0d and Anti Derivative, my bosses, my site was the second most 'leet  €
 €  site on the Net.  I take solace in the fact that I was able to provide    €
 €  this service for so many.  That makes what I have to say harder.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I am taking leave of the scene permanently, so that I may pursue the  €
 €  education that my Internet connection was originally intended to          €
 €  support.  I don't take this decision lightly, but I believe it's one      €
 €  that has to be made.  But before I go, I would like to say a few          €
 €  thoughts about the many things on my mind.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      fATE, as a group, has more dedicated people in it than most groups    €
 €  do.  The new people that fATE constantly recruits only make the group     €
 €  stronger, and more adept at couriering warez.  LeoDLioN has done          €
 €  nothing but work his tail off since he became a senior, and his work      €
 €  is reflected in the number of quality warez couriered by fATE.  Touch     €
 €  Tone is a kickbutt releaser, and Doobie does a good job managing          €
 €  sites.  In general, most of the members of fATE work very hard to get     €
 €  things done for the group on and off the IRC.  My WHQ FTP site, Sickle's  €
 €  Cell FTP, and Sewerat's 13th Floor sites were always full with at least   €
 €  200 megs of 0 day warez.                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Not everything was rosy, though.  During the first week of December,  €
 €  several fATE members had a conference call.  Discussed in this            €
 €  conference call were the future of the group, the image of the group,     €
 €  and the means by which to inflict a positive change in the group's image  €
 €  and standing among all other groups.  The outcome of that discussion      €
 €  called for Anti Derivative and g0d to listen to their members and         €
 €  carefully make judgments on how the group should be run.                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Those included in the conference call were myself, Sickle, Gahn,      €
 €  LeoDLioN, tKLP and IceKitten.  We came to a consensus that having two     €
 €  figureheads at the top of a group was senseless and did not represent     €
 €  the best interests of fATE.  We also figured that it would be easy for    €
 €  us to tell Anti Derivative and g0d what we thought, what we wanted        €
 €  changed, and how we thought it should be done, but they weren't           €
 €  responsive to our thoughts at all and did not wish to hear anything       €
 €  about them.                                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      They accused all of us, especially myself, of conspiring against      €
 €  them to overthrow the heads of fATE.  They couldn't have been more        €
 €  wrong.  Unfortunately, differences between myself and Anti-Derivative     €
 €  and g0d forced me to take permanent leave of fATE.  Several other         €
 €  members left too, including Sickle, IceKitten, Gahn, LeoDLion, and tKLP.  €
 €  LeoDLioN has since returned to fATE to resume his role as an              €
 €  outstanding, fair, moral leader of a group that still lacks the           €
 €  ability to converse with their "true" leaders and resolve real            €
 €  problems.                                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The reasons I left had nothing to do with being thrown out for        €
 €  "conspiring" and had everything to do with ongoing differences between    €
 €  myself and the two at the top.  Even so, this subject, for me, is the     €
 €  most painful to discuss.  Anti Derivative and g0d gave me my start, from  €
 €  a nobody with a fast connection to the sysadmin of a world class          €
 €  Internet FTP service dedicated to the transfer of fATE-tagged warez.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      However, the immaturity of Anti Derivative and g0d got to the better  €
 €  of fATE.  Actions speak louder than words, and their actions have caused  €
 €  much trouble for fATE, so much resentment by other groups, and such hate  €
 €  by individuals.                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      In order to write this I asked to be invited into fATE, and g0d was   €
 €  happy to oblige.  When I told them I was writing this, and told them      €
 €  I believed RTS is number two on the scene, I was promptly kicked.  The    €
 €  following is an excerpt from the logs taken that night...                 €
 €                                                                            €

 €              someone, because he made his opinion..                        €

 €              a bad review? or a review in general?                         €
 €  <aNTi-D> good call g0d                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The dialog speaks for itself.  Having put my personal feelings about  €
 €  Anti Derivative and g0d aside, I believe that their presence in that      €
 €  group and that channel are extremely detrimental to the group.            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      To put it very succinctly, g0d lies, cheats and steals his way to     €
 €  the top.  He puts himself in front of his group.  His agenda is to mow    €
 €  over anything that he believes stands in his way.  He's also threatened   €
 €  my life and he thinks he knows everything about me there is to know. But  €
 €  that's biased.                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      In an unbiased review of g0d, he doesn't think before he acts, which  €
 €  is manifest in his contempt for most members of most other groups.  He    €
 €  has repeatedly insulted the members of Malice.  He considers most groups  €
 €  not worthy of being in the scene.  All that reflects on the group as a    €
 €  whole, not on just g0d himself.                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      His "leadership" is even questioned by the very people he is          €
 €  supposedly leading, namely all those that told him that his kicking me    €
 €  was pathetic, and not called for.  Manic even went so far as to say that  €
 €  it was against his better judgment to say anything against g0d.  Does     €
 €  that mean that the members of fATE fear g0d because if they speak up      €
 €  like I did, they will be victims of more of g0d's rash decisions?         €
 €                                                                            €
 €      To give credit where credit is due, g0d is a good courier, when he    €
 €  does it.  He can move warez with the best of them.  His persistence on    €
 €  some issues and work as a leader has taken fATE to new levels.            €
 €  Unfortunately, ultimately those levels attained were forfeited when g0d   €
 €  began acting ruthlessly and selflessly.                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Anti Derivative, the company president, is a little more mellow than  €
 €  g0d.  While g0d jumps to conclusions, AD tends to be more rational, more  €
 €  subdued when making decisions.                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      A lot has to be said about Anti Derivative.  He is among the most     €
 €  leet people in the scene.  His drive to make fATE the number one group    €
 €  out there is never ending.                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Anti Derivative doesn't play as much into the picture as g0d does,    €
 €  for I believe that g0d controls fATE through the auspices of AD.  For     €
 €  that reason, I have little to say about aNTi-D, other than the fact       €
 €  that he too has threatened my life, most notably during the night on      €
 €  which the preceding log of #fATE was taken.                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Finally, I urge all members of fATE to question their leadership,     €
 €  the benefits (of which there are few) and its detriments (of which there  €
 €  are slightly more than a few), and decide if you really want this type    €
 €  of leadership.                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      You guys were all good guys (and some ladies).  I am going to be      €
 €  sorry that I'm leaving, but like I said, this is a decision that has      €
 €  to be made.  You will all be missed.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹€
 €                                                                            €
 €      I may not know too much about fATE, but I know enough to say that     €
 €  Sucre was definitely one of your best members, and I say MEMBER, because  €
 €  before we even look at the wonders he did for you, we must recognize the  €
 €  dedication he feeded you with.  It happens to be that he ran one of the   €
 €  fastest sites for fATE, which should add to your dismay when you look     €
 €  back at what you have done.  I have a hard time believing that the fATE   €
 €  leadership could treat a person dedicated to them for six months like     €
 €  a bag of dirt.  Six months may not be a lot in human years, not even a    €
 €  lot in dog years, but it's a helluva lot of time in scene years (except   €
 €  to those that have been around for 10 years).  I think fATE's behavior    €
 €  (and yes, I say fATE, because I mean fATE as a whole.  If you're in       €
 €  fATE, it means that the leadership represents you, and if you find that   €
 €  that's not the case, you shouldn't be in fATE in the first place) with    €
 €  Sucre during the time in which the above log was taken is sickening and   €
 €  Sucre deserves a definite appology for it.  I will say no more about      €
 €  this, I think that the outcome of not having Sucre on your team, fATE,    €
 €  will show you what you've done.                                           €

 €   RCMP Const. Tom James said other local bulletin boards have closed down  €
 €   since Tuesday, when two computers and a variety of software were seized  €
 €   from a Westfort residence.                                               €

 €   Police allege an 18 year-old was offering child pornography from a       €
 €   computer bulletin board but it could takes days before any charges are   €
 €   laid.                                                                    €

 €   "It takes a long time to go through a two-gigabyte harddrive,"  said     €
 €   James, who is conducting a dual investigation with Thunder Bay Police.   €
 €   A hard drive that size can hold over 110,000 single-space typed pages    €
 €   or 13,000 graphic images.                                                €

 €   James said the police have to look at all the files on the computers,    €
 €   decide what they want and then secure and backup those files.  If there  €
 €   are pornographic images there is also the possibility of following up    €
 €   some of the files, mostly pictures, to try and find their source and     €

 €     The 18 year old bustee, was ANARCHIST from Demolition and Legacy.      €
 €   While he was in Legacy, he often complained that he did not have enough  €
 €   hard drive space.  Now I know why he had such shortage of space.  It     €
 €   might surprise some that Anarchist was in the front page for 2 days.     €
 €   What boggles the mind is that while being printed in the newspaper, it   €

 €  Articles) I rated 5 of the top couriering groups in the scene today.  It  €
 €  seems that several people thought that my opinions were slightly biased   €
 €  and incorrect.  I feel that I did not provide enough infomation for you,  €
 €  the readers, to fully understand my rating system, and what factors       €
 €  contribute to a group's score.  In this article, I will fully explain     €
 €  how I rated groups in the last review, and clarify my opinions made,      €
 €  hopefully so that you can understand my system.  Before I jump to that,   €

 €          participation in couriering, and how it organizes itself while    €
 €          spreading.  How it communicates between its Internet division     €

 €          dealing with new members, site inquiries, and over all "Heart"    €
 €          of the group.  This is based on how a group handles visitors to   €
 €          their channel and mailed inquiries.  It also takes into account   €
 €          how a group interfaces with other groups, and the general warez   €
 €          public.                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Now that you know what a group needs to do to score higher, let's     €
 €  review last week's article.  I have gotten a lot of response from MALiCE  €

 €      MALiCE is probably the leader in the couriering scene today, with     €
 €  some of the fastest Internet and Telcom sites of any group.  They define  €
 €  excellence in couriering wiht skilled traders from around the world.  I   €
 €  have seen several of their distribution boards, and MALiCE pumps them to  €
 €  their limit.                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Although MALiCE is one of the best couriering teams I have ever       €
 €  seen, and they certainly grabbed a 10 on couriering ability, they just    €
 €  lack talent in other areas, such as relations, group interfacing, etc.    €
 €  My original example of their big-headedness might just be a tad out of    €
 €  date, so I present to you their channel policy.  Only MALiCE members are  €
 €  allowed in the channel, no publicity for this group at all.  This is by   €
 €  far MALiCE's biggest fault.  They do all recruiting by word-of-mouth,     €
 €  which is not too bad, but not too good practice for a long lasting        €
 €  courier group.  This is why my rating of MALiCE was so low last week.     €
 €  I hate those two criteria which each hold 50% of a group's overall        €
 €  rating, so with a 10 in couriering ability and a mere 4 in scene          €
 €  awareness, it averaged out to a 7.                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I have the utmost respect for MALiCE and their accomplishments.       €
 €  They rank right up there with RiSC, but they need definite work in other  €
 €  areas.                                                                    €

 €      The second group, and last in this article, will be RTS.  A few       €
 €  people asked me why I rated RTS so high, beating MALiCE and tying with    €
 €  RiSC.  My rating for RTS is almost a reversal of that of MALiCE.  RTS     €
 €  has had a great year so far, with their couriers and net sites, but they  €
 €  lack the power they had before with strong sites, and superb couriers.    €
 €  Don't get me wrong, their couriers are great, I just don't see the        €
 €  determination of the old RTS, so I rated RTS a 9 in couriering ability.   €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Although RTS is lacking support for their couriers, every day I see   €
 €  RTS traders busting their asses with "relations" work.  What I mean by    €
 €  "relations" is that they have every trader armed with apps and taggers    €
 €  in their XDCC list, going around in group channels and various offer      €
 €  channels offering RTS apps and searching for talent.  I see RTS           €
 €  interfacing with several groups and always getting their name out.  RTS   €
 €  is a fine role model for scene awareness, I could only wish that other    €
 €  groups had so much spirit and enthusiasm as RTS.  This is why I put them  €
 €  so high on my scale, a 9 for couriering ability and a solid 10 for scene  €
 €  awareness.  RTS just needs to keep up the good work and get solid         €
 €  couriering out there.                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      These two groups were the only two that were questioned, so I will    €
 €  let all of you figure out the rest for yourselves.  By the way, if you    €
 €  have any questions or comments regarding my reviews, mail RCN at their    €

 €  Subj : This guy is getting on my nerves....                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      A short while ago, I had the misfortune to read the latest issue of   €
 €  Inquisition.  I must say that not only was I laughing while reading the   €
 €  glob of Razor-biased, lamer nonsense, but I was quite surprised to see a  €
 €  net-lamer's rendition of how Park Central is an "unfair" board.           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      First of all, I should point out that I have nothing against the net  €
 €  as we know it, I never have and I never will, but when I see some little  €
 €  net freak that spends his whole life on the net trying to tell people     €
 €  that Park Central is unfair, it only makes me wonder, where does this     €
 €  guy get off?                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I have nothing against people having opinions, but if you are going   €
 €  to have an opinion on something, you should at least be informed in some  €
 €  fashion of what you are criticizing.  In this case, Razor's "Internet     €
 €  Coordinator" was bashing PC because of our unfairness towards Razor on    €
 €  races.  This "unfairness" is obviously a complete lie, and I will try     €
 €  to explain some of the reasons for this.                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €  1.) In the last few races Razor was smoked on, they complained of having  €
 €      their transfers aborted on PC.  There is only one person that could   €
 €      do that, and that's PC's local sysop, Silver V, which I should        €
 €      mention has never been involved in group politics, and never will.    €
 €      He runs this system as a hobby, and spends a lot of money every       €
 €      month to keep this board going.  The last thing he wants is the       €
 €      heartache of dealing with crybaby groups like Razor.  For the         €
 €      record, the most recent race on Zone Raiders which Razor lost on.     €
 €      Razor was quick to jump to the conclusion that someone was "creating  €
 €      line noise" on their lines and aborting their transfers.  Silver V    €
 €      wasn't even home all day until late that night.  I could probably     €
 €      find close to 10 alibis who were with him at a local bar.  So there   €
 €      goes that sorry... sorry Razor.                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €  2.) The new Razor has been using bullshit propaganda like this for        €
 €      months in an attempt to gain people's sympathy for their pathetic     €
 €      performance on races against the late TDU-JAM! and Hybrid on the      €
 €      major boards.  It seems that their strategy is a run-down the boards  €
 €      that they are losing so miserably on, and to rag on the groups that   €
 €      they are losing to.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  3.) DruidKin who is so carefree in bashing PC, a board he does not even   €
 €      have an account on, and probably doesn't even have an account on ANY  €
 €      major boards.  I don't recall this guy from any groups in the past.   €
 €      I would like to know since when is he an expert on the scene.  It     €
 €      seems to me that he is just another clueless newbie who has been      €
 €      transformed into a slave for Razor's cause.                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €     Obviously you can see that there is a great deal of credibility        €
 €  lacking from Razor's claims against Park Central.  I personally don't     €
 €  appreciate being criticized by this clueless schmuck Druidkin who hasn't  €
 €  been in the real scene as we know it.  If somebody has something to say,  €
 €  they better the hell have some substantiated proof about what they are    €
 €  talking about.  Again I must note that not a single one of these          €
 €  "mysterious logoffs" that Razor is whining about has EVER been proven     €

 €     Inquisition has come out with another one of its great e-mags.  Now,   €
 €  I personally have nothing against iNQ.  The e-mag seems to put out a      €
 €  nice version usually.  One of the prolbems though that I found was in
 €  their last issue.  They seemed to have returned after a two week
 €  vacation.  I think those two weeks were actually to let their egos grow   €
 €  a little bit more.  A comment that struck me as funny was "So RCN can     €
 €  step aside and all you other lame e-mags too.  None of you compare to     €
 €  INQ." - CyberPhreak.  What's going on here?  In looking at their editor   €
 €  list I finally figured out what the problem was.  They have formed a      €
 €  magazine of some of the most egoistical people in the scene today.  Even  €
 €  Lester seems to have gotten into things with his definition of RCN that   €
 €  I'm sure took him no longer than 3 hours to think up.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Malice, DOD, RTS...  All groups that seem to be associated with iNQ.  €
 €  I have nothing against any of the members within these groups.  In fact,  €
 €  I have known some of them to be very friendly.  When I talked to the      €
 €  President of Malice I was greeted by Operator with a "Fuck you;  Why are  €
 €  you bothering him?"  Hey, what more could I ask for?  The structure       €
 €  today of the scene seems to be one oof very egoistical people who seem    €
 €  to think that they are the best and that nobody can join their little     €
 €  "Elite" world.  If you ask me, all of these people must be neo-nazis of   €
 €  the IRC world.                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      When we find a new group trying to make it, instead of showing        €
 €  support and maybe a friendly comment, we seem to be pulling them into an  €
 €  ongoing war.  Why?  Is this the 1996 ego clash?  Are we all really        €
 €  better than those "Other lamers" trying to make it in this community?     €
 €  "If you frequent any decent channels on IRC and actually talk with the    €
 €  people that are sometimes written about and/or mentioned in RCN, you      €
 €  will quickly wade through the line of shit that is written in this mag    €
 €  and notice that what the authors are writing about is just simply for     €
 €  the masses." - GoreFest.  Boy am I glad you wrote this, Gore.  Simply     €
 €  for the masses?  I didn't know that only the people that iNQ deems        €
 €  "cool" are those that WE as in RCN should be writing for!  GoreFest       €
 €  started as a nobody, as we all did.  Who knows how brown his nose got     €
 €  before he rose to who he is today.  In fact, who really cares?  We are    €
 €  all the masses.  No one person is better than another one.  Just because  €
 €  maybe you can get invited into RiSC or maybe MALiCE's channel and talk    €
 €  to a senior.  Maybe you are even a senior in one of these groups.  What   €
 €  makes you better than Jim Smith on #Warez5?  He probably spends most of   €
 €  his time on IRC offering files to people who want them, giving more to    €
 €  the scene than the ego that the people of iNQ seem to cherish so much.    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Oh, a note to iNQ, I really did expect to see much content in iNQ     €
 €  issue 11 being that you had so long to work on it.  I was utterly         €
 €  dismayed when I found that nearly 50% of your mag spoke about RCN :-(.    €

 €                                                                            €
 €      Computer technology is changing faster and faster by the day.  It is  €
 €  said that every six months, something new has become outdated.  Here,     €
 €  we'll look at the future of modems.  The life of modems has changed       €
 €  dramatically over the past few months.  The best modems out in 1994 were  €
 €  14.4's.  Around August, the 28.8 modem came out and sold for around       €
 €  $300.  In today's world, those 28.8 modems have become standard and some  €
 €  warez boards even require that you have one to transfer files.  More      €
 €  and more boards are making the switch to ISDN, some for telnet, some      €
 €  just for direct connections.  ISDN isn't cheap, though, so even the       €
 €  biggest boards are still holding back before they jump on this new        €
 €  technology.                                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      This past month, I have seen at least ten new BBSs that have moved    €
 €  to ISDN.  Splatter King, a Swedish board, has setup an ISDN line          €
 €  dedicated solely to uploading warez.  It's a regular node, only           €
 €  accepting one caller at a time, meant for uploads at 128k speeds.  Zero   €
 €  hour warez are no longer a thing of the Internet alone, they are common   €
 €  on this board.  Before the top boards move to ISDN for Internet access-   €
 €  ability, they will probably move to direct nodes so couriers can have     €
 €  greater uploads in shorter time periods.                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Many boards are moving to ISDN for Internet accessability so that     €
 €  they may attract callers from around the world without a long distance    €
 €  charge.  Not only that, the Internet also allows an unlimited number of   €
 €  nodes via Telnet.  I don't suggest that you go above 4 nodes on a single  €
 €  128k connect, though, as speed will be severely decreased.  The other     €
 €  advantage to using ISDN is that the system operator of a given telnet     €
 €  BBS may change the "number" (IP address) of his server at will.  This is  €
 €  a great security precaution.  One board that is about to try this is      €
 €  the Tower of Sourcery.  It is installing a 128k terminal dedicated to     €
 €  Telnet capabilities, hoping to expand its user base and courier base      €
 €  making it an even more popular board, and opening its doors to a wealth   €
 €  of new users.                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      However, all this speed is not so cheap.  The new digital ISDN        €
 €  terminals (not modems, because on a digital line, there is no need for    €
 €  modulation) can run around $400, not to mention line setups.  Your phone  €
 €  company will charge approximately $50 setup for the line, plus $20/month  €
 €  for the monthly cost.  Be aware, though, that a digital line actually     €
 €  offers TWO lines in one, so you can get yourself a SECOND ISDN terminal   €
 €  (yes, that'll be another $800!) and run it on the same "one" line that    €
 €  you purchased from your phone company!  Once you have your terminal       €
 €  completely setup, you'll probably feel very proud, but don't forget       €
 €  about Internet charges!  Your provider will charge you much more for      €
 €  internet access through ISDN.  After all, you're using up a greater       €
 €  amount of their resources.  Once you do have everything setup, though,    €
 €  you'll be cruising at a sweet 12.8 kilobytes/second.                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Alright, so you're not quite ready for ISDN yet?  Don't feel bad,     €
 €  neither am I.  Your 28.8 will still do just fine for the time being,      €
 €  don't be surprised if in another few months, you'll be at the store       €
 €  searching for prices on a new ISDN terminal.                              €
 €                                                                            €

 €      Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, at one time or another,      €
 €  each and every one of us was a newbie to the scene, or as the 3133+       €
 €  dudes called us, lamers.  Some of us couldn't get into any groups, so we  €
 €  decided to start our own, at least that way we would have an affiliation  €
 €  to list on future apps, and hopefully better our chances of getting in a  €
 €  group.  I myself have run two groups of my own, one releasing, and one    €
 €  couriering.  The releasing group did fair, and managed to release the     €
 €  first working I-phone crack.  The couriering group, however, didn't do    €
 €  so well, and wound up dying two weeks after it was formed.                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Many of the newbies to the scene go through this because most of      €
 €  them can't find someone who is willing to give them a chance, but if      €
 €  nobody ever gives them a chance, then nobody knows what they might be     €
 €  able to do.  Who knows, the next great courier or supplier might be       €
 €  calling some little one node bbs right now, filling out that new user     €
 €  application, and hoping to get on.  When I read the article Hitex wrote   €
 €  (RCN, Issue 10, Articles) I saw myself.  I remember when I used to try    €
 €  getting on k-rad warez boards, only to find out I wasn't cool enough.  I  €
 €  remember when I first got on a good warez board, because a guy who ran a  €
 €  local BBS decided it wouldn't hurt anything for me to leech a few games   €
 €  for his board.  That guy later introduced me to the net, and taught me    €
 €  about IRC.  Prozac, I'd just like to say thanks.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I quickly became addicted, and started leeching like a mad man.       €
 €  Once I learned about all these groups, who I thought were so great for    €
 €  getting us this software for free, I decided that I wanted to be a part   €
 €  of one.  Unfortunately, because I was a 'lamer' nobody would take me.     €
 €  Then one day, about 8-9 months ago, about the same time as Hitex really   €
 €  got started, I noticed this new group called Vendetta, so I thought hey,  €
 €  there's one I haven't applied to yet.  I tried getting an app, but they   €
 €  didn't have one.  I thought oh well, another one down.  About that time,  €
 €  the vice prez, Hitex (Krypton at the time) told me he would talk to me    €
 €  about applying later, after he got his channel back.  I thought, hey,     €
 €  what a way to earn some suck-up points, I'll convince these guys that I   €
 €  want to help them keep the channel, and give it back to Hitex.  Well,     €
 €  needless to say, they were too smart for me, but maybe my intentions      €
 €  worked out, because he decided to give another lamer, that nobody had     €
 €  heard of, a chance.  it it hadn't been for Hitex allowing me into VND, I  €
 €  honestly don't think I would be where I am today.  That helped me get     €
 €  into HWC because I could get them VND releases, then HWC merged with      €
 €  fATE, and then, finally my dream came true, I was in one of the BIG       €
 €  groups, and I even got to be a senior in fATE's releasing section, which  €
 €  soon split off to form RoR.                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Who knows, without Hitex, if I would have ever been in HWC.  If not,  €
 €  I would have never been in fATE, or RoR.  Hitex and Rebel Chicken really  €
 €  are some of the elites of the scene today.  Many don't like them,         €
 €  probably because he gave too many people like me a chance, but I'd like   €
 €  to think that he made the right decision.                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I don't know if anyone understands what I am saying or not, but       €
 €  hopefully if you are a senior of some group, next time you get an app     €
 €  from someone who has no affils, or experience in the scene, you will      €
 €  think that hey, maybe this guy could turn out to be a good member.  If    €
 €  there was nobody to give the newbies a chance there would eventually be   €
 €  nobody in the scene.  Sure, the newbies are annoying, constantly bugging  €
 €  you to be in the group, but they will overcome their excitement soon      €
 €  after they get their first 0 hour ware.  They will begin to understand    €
 €  the scene a little better.  If this article just changes one person's     €
 €  opinion of the little affil-less newbies, then my story was worth it.     €

 €                                                                            €
 €      Being a BBS SysOp used to be something to envy.  Not everyone could   €
 €  afford to have a BBS, the costs were very high.  More recently, BBSs      €
 €  have become virtually commonplace.  The BBS scene has flourished,         €
 €  competition has been on the rise, and boards have gone up in quality.     €
 €  The top boards now consist of 15+ nodes, all pushing at 28.8 kbps or      €
 €  even 33.6 kbps for the lucky ones.  With the advent of the Internet,      €
 €  though, we have been presented with a new form of data transfer, FTP      €
 €  sites.  FTP sites now run on super fast internet connections capable of   €
 €  over 100k/s, assuming perfect efficiency.  For a scene that relies        €
 €  purely on speed, these new holding grounds are obviously the ideal        €
 €  choice.  There are, however, several issues that need to be tackled       €
 €  before we can assume that the warez scene should move to sites.           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      A fast BBS used to be the main form of "declaring a release."  If a   €
 €  group released a program and another group released it 30 minutes later,  €
 €  the seniors could tell which group got to it first by seeing when the     €
 €  release started to get on boards, or, more appropriately, when it got on  €
 €  the competition's World Headquarter.  I, personally, would refine that    €
 €  to say that a release has been declared as soon as it has gotten on a     €
 €  headquarter of a major couriering group, since it is the couriers that    €
 €  are responsible for pushing the warez.  The dilemna arrives when a        €
 €  group tries to claim a release that they put only on FTP sites and on     €
 €  IRC.  If the group's couriers aren't fast enough, or if the release was   €
 €  lost by only a few minutes, it may not have gotten on any BBSs yet.  Is   €
 €  an FTP site a proper "declaration" site?  Some would argue.  I,           €
 €  personally, think that if the site is an official headquarter site of at  €
 €  least one major group, it should be.  FTP sites are very handy for        €
 €  keeping track of things.  They keep track of everything!  Not only do     €
 €  they tell you what date the release was uploaded on, but the time too,    €
 €  down to the nearest second!                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I think that it is evident that FTP sites are a valid form of         €
 €  stating a release, as long as they are big enough, which is the same      €
 €  requirement we would put on a board.  It is not enough to upload a        €
 €  release to a single-node board in Afghanastan and say that you have       €
 €  released it, nor is it enough to upload the release to a 3k/s anonymous   €
 €  FTP site.                                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Another argument that people often make about the Internet as a       €
 €  releasing grounds is that IRC is a perfectly good place to declare a      €
 €  release.  This, I would have to disprove of.  To my knowledge, IRC does   €
 €  not keep a log of any times that anything was offered on or anything to   €
 €  that degree.  Moreover, IRC involves pure word of mouth, never anything   €
 €  definite, so if DOD tries to release Nashville and PWA tries to do the    €
 €  same on the same day, nearly at the same time, and the groups are too     €
 €  dumb (note, this would NEVER happen with such experienced groups, these   €
 €  guys know what to do if they have such a sweet release!) to upload the    €
 €  release to any sites or to any boards, nobody will ever know who really   €
 €  released it first.                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Ultimately, we wouldn't take the word of a small BBS to tell us when  €
 €  a release was done, nor would we take the word of a small FTP site.  We   €
 €  will not take the word of IRC to tell us when a release was done, as we   €
 €  are all a bunch of lying schmucks and would never get anywhere doing      €
 €  that :-).  Those are my two cents, if you have any comments or            €
 €  suggestions, please write in!                                             €

 €   see people that rule (No 0's please) is from their attitude toward       €
 €   other users on IRC and on BBSes in general.  I can say without a doubt   €
 €   that you have a lame ass, I am god attitude, I run a 0-day BBS and now   €
 €   you can suck my dic???  HAHAAAAAAHHHHAAAA I also run a a BBS that gets   €
 €   the files as soon as I snag them from the sites, usually within the a    €
 €   few hours of release AND I don't even have a stuck up attitude.  I       €
 €   still belive in treating other users like people and that we are not     €
 €   better or worse than them.  If a lamer wants access, I don't say shit    €

 €  don't have a clue.  I will admit that I avoid them but every once in a    €
 €  while, I run into a good user from AOL and I was also VERY surprised to   €
 €  see a Warez Scene on AOL.  It is A LOT BIGGER than I would have ever      €
 €  thought possible, and AOL couriers actually work their asses off for      €
 €  what they get, and the fact that they persist and don't just give up      €

 €      I agree with you.  Most people from AOL are very new to computers.    €
 €  Most people who use AOL are the people that are scared to venture into    €
 €  the world of DOS, let alone the world of Internet where they might have   €
 €  to see a Unix Prompt.  People do go by what others say.  Gettin people    €
 €  to think for themselves is something that is going to take a long time.   €
 €  For the past 200 years we as a civilization have come less then half way  €
 €  in thinking for ourselfes.  We all seem to take a "kin" to somebody who   €
 €  in our minds looks like a cool person, someobody who maybe leads MaLiCE   €
 €  or RTS.  When somebody screams "Aol!" we all seem to head for our ban     €
 €  command and hide behind the ego that somebody is trying cover us with.    €
 €  The problem with thinking for ourselves is that if we do not conform to   €
 €  the accepted mold, rumors start flying around that we are "Lame" or not   €
 €  cool enough to be around.                                                 €

 €                                                                            €
 €      I wanted to make a statement about AOL piraters.  Most IRCers think   €
 €  that AOL is full of lamers that courier 2-3 year old releases.  They      €
 €  also believe that all of AOL is full of mindless 13 year olds begging     €
 €  for games.  They are MOSTLY right, but there is a section of AOL which    €
 €  have a few elites.  They are not really elite like IRC elite but they     €
 €  are more elite than the avergae #Warez5 IRCer.  IRCers don't see much of  €
 €  AOL's warez because it is hidden well.  These people have their own       €
 €  private rooms and never go to  the warez rooms, which makes #Warez look   €
 €  like heaven.  A group called ALLiED is a group full of 0 day uploaders    €
 €  and are all old and respected warez people.  ALLiED members get 0 day in  €
 €  their mailbox every day, yes, I said 0 day.  Believe it or not, AOL does  €
 €  get 0 day and are sometimes faster than most boards.  I get 0 day in my   €
 €  mail box from four great AOL groups named UPS, Mystic, SPIN, and SNT.     €
 €  I often get releases a few hours after they were released on the NET.     €
 €  AOL is actually faster than many IRC channels.  AOL is not as lame as     €
 €  people think.  There is more to the AOL piracy scene than the lame        €
 €  warez rooms.                                                              €

 €      I happen to agree with you on many points.  I have seen AOL groups    €
 €  move warez faster than Net Couriers.  It is amazing, we have so much to   €
 €  work with in the area of speed and how easy it is to get a fast site.     €
 €  People on AOL have to work a lot harder than we do.  Getting people to    €
 €  accept them is a huge problem.  AOL is an extension of IRC, one that      €
 €  is there whether or not we choose to admit it's existence.  The days of   €
 €  text based environments are leaving faster than we care to admit.  They   €
 €  are behing replaced by the great GUI interface that is taken over the     €
 €  majority of households.  Accepting AOL'ers into the internet is a way to  €
 €  expand and make the scene the best that it can be.                        €
 €                                                                            €

 €  be as cool, as people from fATE or MALiCE.  No?  It appears not.  fATE    €

 €  #Warez.  Sure, #Warez1 is better  than #Warez5, but why?  Is this just    €
 €  another case of how our little society would like to stay in its own      €
