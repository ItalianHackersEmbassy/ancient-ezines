 €           Apparently Raptor, their main editor, or something like that,    €
 €   has vanished off the face of the Earth.  Well, not quite, according to   €
 €   iNQ #10, he's still around, just finally found out about women or        €
 €   something like that, hehehe.  Oh, if you haven't seen Issue 10 of iNQ    €
 €   yet, you should look out for it.  Though about 2 weeks late, it's        €
 €   around.  Mostly a message saying that the mag isn't dead, because        €
 €   there's not much else in it.                                             €

 €           Your magazine is WHOOPING on iNQUISITION!!  Keep up the great    €
 €   work, I enjoy reading your e-mag every week, and don't want to see it    €
 €   go.  Disregard that fuckin' bull shit that iNQUISITION said in Issue     €
 €   10.  I can't believe they've got the balls to say that they're still     €
 €   #1 after all that shit.  For two issues straight they've been talking    €
 €   about shit that has nothing to do with WaReZ and all of a sudden they    €
 €   publish poems and jokes.  When I read a mag, I don't want to read what   €
 €   Lurch or whoever turned into his English class the day before.  I want   €

 €      We got the idea for this project a few issues back when we didn't     €
 €  know what to write about for the next issue and were feeling that both    €
 €  of the e-mags were beginning to get a little repetitive, and that we      €
 €  needed to have something new, yet something essential for the warez       €
 €  public to hear of.  While brainstorming, it seeemed that almost on the    €
 €  same note, Rebel Chicken and I jumped and said "Let's interview the       €
 €  FBI!!!"  We giggled a bit, laughed at our apparent stupidity,             €
 €  childishness, and moreover, FOOLISHNESS, and continued to brainstorm.  I  €
 €  don't think we were at all forgetting about this new idea, though, and    €
 €  not five minutes later, we came back to it.                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      We began to think more rationally, and attempted to find a way of     €
 €  having a close encounter with the Federal Bureau of Investigation         €
 €  without risking our own safety.  We have worked over the period of        €
 €  approximately three weeks to try to get you the best scoop that we        €
 €  could.  We feel that our coverage is very thorough and that we have done  €
 €  an awesome job getting the important facts out, the facts that we should  €
 €  all know if we're going to stay in this business.  We sincerely hope      €
 €  that you will enjoy this section, we have spent many hours working on     €
 €  it, and we are quite sure that you will find it useful and informative.   €

 €  Now for some background information:                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Recently a new branch of the FBI opened up near our area, San         €
 €  Francisco, California, USA.  The main reason that this agent knew so      €
 €  much about the topic we were studying is (apart from a bit of luck on     €
 €  our part) that this branch is dedicated to the investigation of computer  €
 €  related crimes.  A bit for my own good, I wanted to investigate this to   €
 €  see if they were coming for me, or for the perverts that hang out on      €
 €  #gaysex and trade GIFs.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  How us Mofos started this search:                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €      We started by finding a good, comfortable pay phone, namely one with  €
 €  a nice, soft chair, that we could sit on for the length of an interview   €
 €  and be no less comfortable than we would be if we were sitting our asses  €
 €  in front of IRC :-).  We spotted the perfect one, nice, deserted area,    €
 €  and a soft chair!  We were rather excited, went back home, got the        €
 €  number to the department, a tape recorder (despite the fact that the      €
 €  FBI agent preferred we didn't tape it) and headed back to our site.  We   €
 €  called the office, asked to speak with the press person, and were         €
 €  greeted by a very nice person (as most press-people should be!).  We      €
 €  asked whether or not anybody would be able to grant us a phone interview  €
 €  and just as she was about to decline, she spotted an agent that didn't    €
 €  seem to be doing much.  She transferred us to his line, and the           €
 €  interview began (We got a tad more nervous :-).  Here, read on!!!         €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : The FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) was first started in an   €
 €        attempt to arrest Al Capone for his bootlegging crimes.  Since the  €
 €        computer age, the government has ushered a new objective for this   €
 €        force.  No longer is the FBI solely responsible for drug dealing    €
 €        and homicides, but they have been granted a greater jurisdiction    €
 €        because it is now responsible for the investigation of other        €
 €        high-tech computer related crimes.  What are your main concerns     €
 €        involving computer crime?                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Computer crime has brought upon us a much more difficult form of    €
 €        crime to investigate.  Currently, our main interests involving      €
 €        computer crime are to eliminate child pornography, credit card      €
 €        fraud, and grand theft.  Such crimes are difficult to investigate   €
 €        because of the distance between the investigator and the suspect,   €
 €        the ease of impersonation, and the Constitution, which keeps us     €
 €        from breaking into high-level programs to grab information about    €
 €        a suspect.  This is still a relatively new field for us, and due    €
 €        to the high rate of development and advancement in technology,      €
 €        our staff's methods must keep up with those of the criminals.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Can you please elaborate on the three main concerns that the FBI    €
 €        department is facing?                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Credit card fraud involves people hacking into the Internet and     €
 €        virtually tapping lines where they grab credit card numbers. Then   €
 €        they use the cards as they would their own, often buying thousands  €
 €        of dollars' worth of goods.  Child pornography has come to an       €
 €        all time high this past year.  Pornography has always been around,  €
 €        but it seems that a new form of it has plagued us.  Explicit        €
 €        photographs of boys and girls as young as 8 years old have been     €
 €        found on the Internet, and the government has not been able to do   €
 €        anything about it due to their limited control of people "freely    €
 €        expressing" themselves.  Grand theft is estimated to have been      €
 €        going on for roughly 15 years, making it one of the oldest          €
 €        computer crimes around.  Grand theft often involves the trading     €
 €        of unlicensed software, severely hurting software distribution      €
 €        companies.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What keeps the government from completely banning child             €
 €        pornography?                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : The United States of America is just that, a set of states, united  €
 €        under one law, the Constitution.  However, the 10th amendment       €
 €        states that all laws not clearly defined within the bill of         €
 €        rights be given to the states.  Thus, different states have quite   €
 €        different laws, including those of child pornography.  Keeping      €
 €        within the laws would be simple for each individual state, but      €
 €        with the Internet, it has become virtually impossible to control    €
 €        data, as most of the time, one does not even know what state s/he   €
 €        is sharing data with.  Even with the passing of laws regulating     €
 €        such activity, enforcement would be extremely difficult if not      €
 €        impossible.                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Recently many major software companies, such as Novell and          €
 €        Microsoft, have made a lot of noise about their software being      €
 €        illegaly copied.  Apparently this has been going on in excess of    €
 €        fifteen years.  What keeps the FBI from taking down all the people  €
 €        that pirate software?                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Software piracy occurs in many forms.  One way is when a person     €
 €        simply copies programs for another person on disk, and trades it    €
 €        in person.  Another very common way is online.  The Internet is     €
 €        filled with forums dedicated to computer piracy, and then there     €
 €        are computer Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) that are also dedicated  €
 €        to piracy.  Restricting trade on the internet, much like with       €
 €        child pornography, is virtually impossible because of the freedom   €
 €        of speech and expression.  The FBI has quite a presence on the      €
 €        Internet sites and chat channels, but can't really do much about    €
 €        what it sees.  BBSs are slightly easier to deal with.  If the FBI   €
 €        gathers enough incriminating information about a certain system     €
 €        (which often takes years to achieve), it may receive a search       €
 €        warrant to raid the operator's house.  The FBI currently has        €
 €        access to a number of the "top" BBSs, most of which have over TEN   €
 €        incoming phone lines.  I can not give specific information on       €
 €        upcoming busts, but I will reveal that the FBI is working on some   €
 €        very significant ones, and is constantly trying to end this costly  €
 €        crime that is causing American companies huge losses.               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is the usual procedure when a person gets "busted" for         €
 €        software piracy?                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : It's rather depressing, because the majority of the time, when we   €
 €        catch someone pirating software, it is a person under the age of    €
 €        eighteen.  We don't want a punishment so light that the minor will  €
 €        disregard it and commit the crime once again, but we don't want a   €
 €        punishment so stern that it will ruin the person's life.  When an   €
 €        adult is caught, the outcomes can be quite serious.  Fines in the   €
 €        hundred thousands are often imposed, and all computer equipment     €
 €        containing illegal material is seized.  Being caught for such       €
 €        white-collar crimes can really mess up a person's life.             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is your main hinderance from being able to take down any and   €
 €        all BBSs that you find in violation of piracy laws?                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We know about many, many boards in violation of such laws.  We can  €
 €        even gain access to many of them, but the FBI is in sort of a       €
 €        catch-22.  When we log on to a BBS, we often find a message         €
 €        stating either that if we are in the FBI, we must disconnect        €
 €        promptly, or that we must leave a message to the operator stating   €
 €        why we want access to a board.  If, however, we do gain access to   €
 €        a BBS, our worries are by no means over.  We have to find a file    €
 €        containing illegal software and be able to "download" it.  Before   €
 €        we can do this, however, we often have to send the BBS something    €
 €        of our own.  That is where our search generally ends.  If we get    €
 €        involved in sending a BBS some pirated software, we are in turn in  €
 €        violation of the law.  Such activities are different from drug      €
 €        dealing where the FBI is allowed to go undercover, and even         €
 €        impersonate a drug dealer.  However, whenever we logon to a board   €
 €        we are stepping into someone's house and must abide by their        €
 €        rules.  Thus, we must have a search warrant.                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How, then, do you ever take down a BBS?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Our main resource is Narcs.  When we catch a person and impose      €
 €        sky-high fines on them, they are usually willing to do just about   €
 €        anything to keep from having to pay them.  This is how we find      €
 €        the biggest of boards and stop them.                                €
 €                                                                            €

 €      Due to the fact that our interview was done by phone, the personal    €
 €  level of contact was not there, and the FBI agent felt free to end it as  €
 €  soon as he had to go.  Approximately 15 minutes into the interview, we    €
 €  were forced to end it because he had a call on the other line (DOH!).     €
 €  I think this should be a wake-up call for all of us.  It sure was for     €
 €  us.  We often forget how vulnerable we are.  This interview clearly       €
 €  shows what we must do to keep from getting busted, and I'm quite          €
 €  confident that if we follow those steps, we will be alright for the next  €
 €  few years at least.  We should keep on our toes, though, and keep up      €
 €  with the times.  Congress is constantly debating bills that mostly        €
 €  involve the regulation of child pornography, but could quite easily       €
 €  effect us as well.                                                        €

 €   Q  : You have comments that Razor 1991 should have been rated the #1     €
 €        games group in "Best of 1995 Games" in RCN #7.  What are your       €
 €        reasons for thinking that?                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, Razor dominated the floppy scene for the majority of 1995,    €
 €        and became a top notch CD group before the year's end, there is no  €
 €        reason for Razor not to be #1.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Many people also believe that the late group, Genesis, was the      €
 €        best in floppy, as far as cracking.  There were many rumors that    €
 €        Razor floppy games were not cracked, and there were many group      €
 €        problems, such as the conflict between The Renegade Chemist and     €
 €        The Speed Racer.                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Genesis was nowhere near the best.  Razor dominated, as seen in     €
 €        any warez report.  Genesis was known for their low budget titles    €
 €        and as a result got the nickname 'budgetis'.  Being an ex-Razor     €
 €        member, I had tried all the games, and they were all cracked. That  €
 €        is just a rumor.  The Speed Racer and The Renegade Chemist had a    €
 €        power struggle which was at the beginning of the year, resulting    €
 €        in The Renegade Chemist's dismissal.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Were there any problems with Genesis releases that would make       €
 €        Razor superior?                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Genesis was budget, and their releasing near the end was minimal    €
 €        because Razor ruled europe, and Europe was the only place floppy    €
 €        titles were coming from near the end.  Genesis titles were between  €
 €        15-20$, BARGAIN discount titles.  They were not as shitty as        €
 €        Tyranny, but they released a bunch of cheap shit.                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : You are an ex-Razor member, why are you an "EX"?                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : TSR and I were in an argument about certain things within Razor.    €
 €        One thing led to another and i told TSR to remove me from the       €
 €        group NFO.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What was your position in Razor?                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Razor Council.                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What were your responsibilities when you were Razor Council?        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I was one of the Razor leaders along with Pharaoh, TSR, The Gecko,  €
 €        and Third Son.  I took care of my "division" within Razor.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is meant by "division"?                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Razor is separated into many "divisions", each with its own leader  €
 €        to make sure things run smoothly.                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What division were you in charge of?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : The uhh... "creative calling" division... :)                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What were some of Razor's internal conflicts between TSR and TRC?   €
 €        What happened within Razor that made TRC split away and start       €
 €        Eclipse?                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : The problem was, TRC wanted the group to fold, but TSR/The Gecko,   €
 €        and the rest of the crowd wanted Razor to live on, TRC released     €
 €        "Razor is dead" text file, but Razor kept releasing, and a short    €
 €        while later, a vote came to see whether or not to let TRC back in,  €
 €        and they voted not to.  As for Eclipse, that took a while, TRC      €
 €        wanted to become the leader of Fairlight, but that didn't work      €
 €        out, then he joined Tyranny, and Cyber Angel made it clear to  TRC  €
 €        that he wouldn't be the leader so he grabbed his remaining          €
 €        "people" in Razor, and with some outside sources, formed another    €
 €        floppy games group, Eclipse.                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why did TRC want the group to "fold?" at it's prime when Razor was  €
 €        the #2 floppy games group?                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Razor had very serious financial problems, and was being beaten     €
 €        by Genesis at the time, so i guess he thought there was no hope     €
 €        and decided to kill the group.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What do you mean by financial problems?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : They did not have the money to pay back the suppliers for the       €
 €        originals.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What the FUCK?  Razor BOUGHT their releases???                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Of course, every major group does, or at least some of the titles.  €
 €        That's what distribution sites are for, to keep a balanced budget.  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are your views on Hybrid?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Hybrid could be a great group, but they have run into a BIG load    €
 €        of financial problems.  That's why their have had no releases       €
 €        since 1996.                                                         €

 €      I read the interview thoroughly and have a few things to say to you,  €
 €  Evil Current, and any other people that think that Razor should have      €
 €  beaten Genesis out in '95.  First off, I remember quite vividly a moment  €
 €  last year when Razor was having a hard time releasing anything at all.    €
 €  I can't complain about that, though, because there were very few disk     €
 €  games to release, and Genesis understood that before you did.  Razor was  €
 €  a very good group in '95, kept quality very high, but I can't endore      €
 €  that Genesis was a "budget" group.  I just can't say that any of the      €
 €  following releases are "budget."  Heck, I'm inspired now... I WOULD       €
 €  compare releases from both groups, but fuck, Razor didn't do rzr-*.zip    €
 €  in their releases so I can't identify their releases.  Alright, I'll      €
 €  just name some of the more impressive Genesis releases of '95, we'll let  €
 €  our readers decide if they are "budget" ($19.99 or less :-) releases.     €
 €                                                                            €

 €   A  : Well, it has been an ongoing thing with him.  He has been banned    €
 €        several times from the group for various reasons.  Tonight was the  €
 €        final straw when one of our ansi artists said he could not be in    €
 €        the group anymore because Physical Form had been bugging him to     €
 €        join another group called aCe.                                      €

 €   Q  : What did he have against DMN?                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We demoted him from senior to council just because he was a pain    €
 €        to work with.  We should have just kicked him out.                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why do you think he was trying to take members from DMN and take    €
 €        them into aCe?                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Basically, I think that he was doing it because he knew that his    €
 €        days in DMN were coming to a close.  He is not a bad recruiter, so  €
 €        that is why we kept him in.                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : In what ways has he previously compromised DMN's integrity?         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : He was supposed to find us some more suppliers by January 8, or he  €
 €        would be kicked out.  I guess he's been saying to everyone that     €
 €        DMN has never released anything since its first day.                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So he had a plot to ruin DMN?                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : At least that is what I was told by the ansi artist.  I don't know  €
 €        if it was a plot but he was definitely trying to steal members      €
 €        away from the group.  He has been using his affiliation with DMN    €
 €        to get people into aCe.  He would tell people he was a member of    €
 €        DMN, but that he was in a better group called aCe.                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Is it true that Physical Form applied to groups with multiple       €
 €        aliases, hoping to get accepted as one of them?                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I would not put that past him, I have seen him in our channel with  €
 €        different nicks just to watch.  He thinks he isn't seen, but he is  €
 €        an all around lame dude that will bug you about something until     €
 €        you give in.  I guess that is what made him a good recruiter.       €

 €   A  : He's a lame ass little kid that did everything to give DMN a bad    €

 €        to annoy me and other people, he has turned totally around.  He's   €

 €   A  : Well, for one, he's a lame kid, and people even laugh at DMN and    €
 €        look down on us when they see that Physical Form is in our NFO.     €
 €        I have seen countless times people putting him down, and us for     €
 €        having him in DMN.                                                  €

 €        bad reputation?                                                     €

 €   A  : Just having him in DMN is bad advertisement, he acts too immature   €
 €        to be in a group, much less COUNCIL!  He was even stupid enough to  €
 €        try to discourage new applicants from joining.  We gave him many    €
 €        chances to get suppliers, but he's too lazy.  Then, he also annoys  €
 €        me EVERY day.                                                       €

 €   A  : Actually, it is Silicon's group.  I've known Silicon since he       €
 €        started aCe approximately 2 months ago.  No biggie, they're not     €
 €        well known yet.                                                     €

 €        his high position in DMN to steer people away from DMN and into     €
 €        aCe?                                                                €

 €   A  : He tried to discouraged new applicants, who could supply, from      €
 €        joining DMN, by saying that we HAVE NEVER Released, what a bunch    €
 €        of bull shit.  Actually, I believe Physical Form won't be in aCe    €
 €        much longer.  I know all the high up people in aCe, let's just say  €

 €        them, for stealing members to aCe, another group you are in, how    €
 €        do you feel, now that you are no longer in DMN?  Do you feel that   €

 €   A  : I have not, tried to steal any DMN members.  I only asked some of   €
 €        there suppliers, if they wanted to join aCe, because aCe is a       €
 €        games group, not a utils group.  Since the boot from DMN, it was    €
 €        harsh, because it was a pretty good group.  My Status in aCe is     €

 €   Q  : Ice Kitten, you were dismissed from fATE, there are rumors that     €
 €        you left the group, and there are rumors that you were kicked out?  €
 €        Which is true?                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : #Fatefiles was taken over by a small band of irc people who         €
 €        decided to keep it all day.  I was unaware until I came along much  €
 €        later that day.  Well it so happened that one of the guys who took  €
 €        it over was a friend of mine way back when I was a little lamer on  €
 €        the undernet.  So we started talking and he invited me into the     €
 €        locked down #Fatefiles.  When he invited me, I just sat in there.   €
 €        I was talking to a member of fATE, storm, who was desynched and     €
 €        was logging the channel.  He decided to post only small parts of    €
 €        our conversation.  I was getting tired of fATE anyways, they are    €
 €        rude, and more concerned about politics and STARTING wars, than     €
 €        couriering warez.  I was basically kicked out for associating with  €
 €        someone who took it over cause I was given the opportunity to take  €
 €        the channel back when my friend opped me.  I told him to deop me    €
 €        immediately and he did.  A couple of fATE members, after seeing     €
 €        what happened through Storm's log file, called me a traitor,        €
 €        Others understood.  They did fire me, and then I asked them to let  €
 €        me resign.  So officially, I resigned.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How did fATE regain control of #Fatefiles?                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Those guys who took the channel decided to give it back 20 minutes  €
 €        after I got involved.  fATE was caught with their pants down and    €
 €        couldn't take it back.  That is what fATE deserves when they got    €
 €        a guy like g0d who goes around starting wars with every other       €
 €        group.                                                              €

 €   Q  : Storm tattle-taled on you?                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I guess he is a "loyal" fATE member.  He is pretty nice, but I did  €
 €        not like how he tried to make me look bad.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What were your duties as a member of fATE?                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I was a net courier.  I filled up the sites like you wouldn't       €
 €        believe.  Ask Doobie, he is the main site operator.  I also         €
 €        offered files in the channel about 10-16 hours a day.  I was a      €
 €        very dedicated member and Anti Derivative can't disagree with       €
 €        anyone on that.                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are your feelings of fATE now that you are no longer in it?    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I have bad feelings toward them.  They lost a very good member due  €
 €        to LAME politics.  If you want to fire someone, get rid of them     €
 €        because they aren't doing their job.  Not because they decided NOT  €
 €        to pick sides in lame wars.  So now I am much happier.  No more     €
 €        soap operas.  I get to focus on writing KittyKill v1.7, setting up  €
 €        my site, and couriering!                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Would you ever take a fATE invitation if they forgave you?          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No.  If they invited me, I would certainly decline.  I would        €
 €        rather quit the warez scene than go back to fATE.  They need to do  €
 €        some serious improvements before they end up dying.                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What has life been like after fATE?                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I'm happy.  I'm 22 years old, married and have a little daughter.   €
 €        She is 1 year and 3 months old, and she already has her own         €
 €        computer.  Oh, and get this, g0d asked me to setup a fATE site      €
 €        after all that trouble!  I said I would think about it, and I did,  €
 €        and decided to go to MALiCE instead, where they courier instead of  €
 €        argue.                                                              €

 €   Q  : In issue 7 of RCN, Ordnance said that you left RTS because you      €
 €        wanted to start a new group?  Would you care to comment on the      €
 €        reasons why you left RTS?                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I did not leave RTS to start my own group, Death Stalker, an RTS    €
 €        coordinator at the time, did not like me a whole lot.  I still do   €
 €        not know why, but he kept saying that he was going to kick me out   €
 €        of RTS.  So I got tired and left, I then joined NAFTA, another      €
 €        courier group.  At that time, I still had not thought of starting   €
 €        my own group.  When NAFTA died, there were no other decent courier  €
 €        groups (I didn't think RTS would want me back, and I didn't call    €
 €        long distance enough to even try for RiSC), so I decided to see     €
 €        what I could do at running a courier group.  As I said before,      €
 €        MindCrash is not out to compete with the other big courier groups,  €
 €        we just want to help the scene.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : MindCrash has grown in size and power since its original birth      €
 €        many months ago.  MindCrash is now the official courier group for   €
 €        two release groups, how will MindCrash grow in the future and what  €
 €        are its goals?                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : MindCrash is the official courier group for 3 groups.  We are very  €
 €        proud of our new affiliations, Legacy, Mayhem, and The Sixthed      €
 €        Circle.  All 3 of these groups have been really great to work with  €
 €        and have been very helpful for us.                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What do you feel about other courier groups, such as RiSC, RTS,     €
 €        and MALiCE?                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : MALiCE is kind of the old RTS I was in, RTS is now making a HUGE    €
 €        come back, and I've seen many RTS tagged files in the past few      €
 €        days.  RiSC is just plain RiSC, the most respected courier group    €
 €        in the scene.                                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is your opinion on Pre-tagging?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I think pretagging is fine with courier groups who are official     €
 €        for certain release groups.  If a courier group has proven          €
 €        themselves enough to a release group to become "official" couriers  €
 €        for them, then I think pre-tagging may be the best way to           €
 €        coordinate things.  After all, if one argument of the tagging       €
 €        issue is true, then it doesn't matter who tagged it, it only        €
 €        matters who uploaded it.  And if that argument is true, then Pre-   €
 €        tagging is almost a way to greet your official couriers in each     €
 €        release                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : While you were in RTS, what exactly turned you off besides Death    €
 €        Stalker, what finally made you LEAVE?                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Oh, I loved RTS.  I did not want to leave at all.  Death Stalker    €
 €        told me he was going to make sure I got kicked out, so he told the  €
 €        seniors that I was not uploading to my assigned board.  He was      €
 €        halfway right, because my modem was broken for almost a week.  I    €
 €        immediately bought a new one via express mail, but that is not      €
 €        giving me a fair shake.  After that week, I uploaded 50+ megs in    €
 €        one night then he told me i was kicked out.  I asked Dorian if I    €
 €        was kicked out and he said "No way, we just want you to courier to  €
 €        your board." - or something to that effect.  I expressed to Dorian  €
 €        the problems between Death Strike and me, I do not know if he       €
 €        ever believed me.  But in the end, I decided that I could not work  €
 €        for a guy that had it in for me since the beginning, so I told      €
 €        Dorian i had to leave.                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Where is Deathstrike now?  Is he in Malice or RTS?                  €

 €   A  : Death Stalker eventually left RTS, taking many members with him,    €
 €        to start a courier group called Raw Meggage.  Death Stalker ran a   €
 €        courier group called United Couriers before he was in RTS, so he    €
 €        knew what he was doing.  However, even though Death Stalker had     €
 €        experience, Raw Meggage never went anywhere.  Death Stalker is no   €
 €        where to be found now.  I don't know what happened to him.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : If you were invited to RTS or Malice as a courier, would you leave  €
 €        your current position in MindCrash to join them?                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, I could not do that.  My first priority is my couriers.  I do   €
 €        not care what I have to do, I will do it for them, I owe it to      €
 €        them for the work they do for me.  If they think they need a        €
 €        better President, I will step down then and only then, might I      €
 €        think about joining RTS or MALiCE as a courier, not that they'd     €
 €        want me anyway.                                                     €

 €      This article sparks off of RCN issue #7, the "Mikeysoft" problems.    €
 €  It seems that Mikeysoft and the "irc.portal.com" IRCOp staff have teamed  €
 €  up to fight for a lost cause.  After the Mikeysoft rumor was spread, and  €
 €  and the two groups fought over it (DMN-DTC), emerged some angry users,    €
 €  not angry at Mikeysoft anymore, but angry at the IRCOps, it seems Piker,  €
 €  the ADMIN at irc.portal.com made a list of unregistered KILLS in several  €
 €  channels, such as #Fatefiles and #Demolition. These kills were uncalled   €
 €  for and labeled by the admin as, normal BOT kills.  But few users who     €
 €  were victims claim the same story.  Violator of DMN, logged each and      €
 €  and every one of his /kills to a filelog, and vows to use them against    €
 €  Piker by sending it in to other Admins across the net.  These attempts    €
 €  were met with hostility from other IRCOps, but were proven that Ops were  €
 €  not fond of going up against one another.  This raises a new question,    €
 €  have the IRCOps joined together in one big group, in an effort against    €
 €  all of IRC, vowing never to fight against another?  These are the         €
 €  questions that we want answered, but will these questions be heard?       €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The problem with user response is that they all fear the IRCOps,      €
 €  thinking that an IRCOp will /kill them when they come on, or kill them    €
 €  when they speak to them.  And that fear is wrong, I cannot believe that   €
 €  IRC could ever become so hostile in such a short period of time.  I am    €
 €  also angry at the IRCOps who do not confront other IRCOps who do wrong!   €
 €  It has been a few weeks since the problem with Piker, and there are       €
 €  still no responses, and no actions.  This gives users of IRC a reason to  €
 €  fear the IRCOps, because as "Piker" epitomized, IRCOps can do anything    €
 €  to anyone, without reason, right or wrong, and it will go unheard and     €
 €  unpunished.  So users on irc, beware, the "irc.portal.com" IRCOps, they   €
 €  can do whatever they want, to whomever they please.                       €

 €      When I looked ahead to '96 last year, I expected to see some new      €
 €  faces in the release and courier scene.  In the first week of 1996, the   €
 €  only major game releasing powers that showed us anything were Legacy and  €
 €  Razor 1911.  I was surprised not to see anything from Hybrid, which was   €
 €  quite obviously the biggest release power of the second half of '95.  I   €
 €  assumed, however, that they would release shortly, and probably whoop on  €
 €  the rest of us again, much like they did in '95.  I was wrong.  An early  €
 €  visit to #HYBRID this morning yielded a virtually empty channel, it       €
 €  contained only Hybrid's bot, until that too went down in a split.  I      €
 €  investigated around and the best that I could find was "Well, I HEARD     €
 €  Hybrid was dead, but why would they go down so abruptly?!"                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      It didn't make sense!  There could be only three answers to this.     €
 €  (Oh, if you have any other plausible reasons, please mail them in!)       €
 €                                                                            €
 €               1.  The leadership decided to call it quits.                 €
 €               2.  They decided to PLAY games (with our minds)              €
 €                   instead of RELEASING them :-).                           €
 €               3.  Hybrid is in EXTREME financial problems with             €
 €                   FanFan La Tulipe!                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      1.  We saw it in TDU-JAM, and many other groups.  A group of          €
 €  leaders, after months of hard work making it to #1, decides to call it    €
 €  quits.  If this is the reason to Hybrid's death, it is a respectable      €
 €  one, and after all, they came down at their prime.                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      2.  They just got tired of releasing games.  Yeah, that's it, they    €
 €  just wanted to play with our minds, and are probably pondering a new      €
 €  name for the group as we speak!  I mean, why would such an awesome        €
 €  group go down so suddenly, with no warning, and heck, not even a TXT      €
 €  file stating the death of the group?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      3.  According to Toast, of Razor 1911, Hybrid somehow got themselves  €
 €  caught up in a financial disaster with the ex-leader of TDU-JAM, FanFan   €
 €  La Tulipe!  We haven't too many specific details, but to the naked eye,   €
 €  there would seem to be no reason why Hybrid and TDU-JAM would get         €
 €  involved in any money transfers.                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Hybrid was an awesome group that served us with some of the best      €
 €  quality in CD games releases ever.  It might be too early to tell         €
 €  exactly what happened, but Hybrid wasn't perfect, and they may have       €
 €  had internal problems that we just never found out about.  Who knows,     €
 €  those internal problems may have been what lead to its potential slump.   €
 €                                                                            €

 €  Note : You might want to read the Interview with Evil Current before      €
 €         reading this article, so you may get better background             €
 €         information on the topic.  Enjoy!                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The scene began as a form of getting software without having to pay   €
 €  for it.  Ultimately this was for the benefit of the end user, perhaps     €
 €  you.  It was taken for granted that if the end user doesn't pay for the   €
 €  program, the group itself shouldn't either.  Groups would get new         €
 €  releases via store suppliers, who would upload them to a supplier HQ FTP  €
 €  site, where the group seniors would grab it, test it, crack it, package   €
 €  it, and send it on its way.  Once off, the release would be tossed        €
 €  around the world within a matter of hours, and would finally end up on    €
 €  warez boards.  However, it seems that something very different is in      €
 €  fact happening.                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      As we learned from the interview with Evil Current, virtually all of  €
 €  the larger groups actually pay their suppliers for the warez that they    €
 €  supply.  I don't know if this applies only to games, I suspect that it    €
 €  does, as on the utils side of the market, releases are more abundant.     €
 €  I doubt that the suppliers, most likely store suppliers, paid for the     €
 €  software that they supplied, though, so it turns out that the only one    €
 €  profiting is the supplier.  Groups would make up for the lost funds by    €
 €  charging their member boards and distribution sites a fee for the         €
 €  assigning of a courier to their location, and oftentimes not even that.   €
 €  So far I understand that Genesis, Razor 1911, Hybrid, and TDU-JAM have    €
 €  paid their suppliers and charged their boards to make up for the cost.    €
 €  This is to say that pretty much all the games groups pay their            €
 €  suppliers.                                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I hate to mention Legacy, being that it is my group, because I feel   €
 €  that my words will be assumed to be completely biased, but I'll say this  €
 €  much: Legacy in no way will EVER pay a supplier to supply us with warez,  €
 €  nor will it ever charge a member board or distro site to carry our tag.   €
 €  It might sound idealistic but the truth is that all Legacy members        €
 €  believe in a common goal that we are here to help the scene by giving     €
 €  away FREE games.  If our suppliers are unable to attain software without  €
 €  paying for it, they will be responsible for the funds, as the problem     €
 €  should end at their level.                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The whole cycle, from the supplier to the board to the end user,      €
 €  should not result in the transfer of any money between the groups, the    €
 €  boards, and the suppliers.  We like to tell ourselves that the scene is   €
 €  just a game and we're all here to have fun, but games never involve       €
 €  money.                                                                    €

 €                                                                            €
 €      I would like to say a few words about a recent release.  I spent 9    €
 €  hours one night downloading a program that I was told to be "Killer".     €
 €  It was "The Planets" released by ROR.  After leeching for an eternity, I  €
 €  got this BIG 36 Disker ??(Check please) release, this was after going to  €
 €  ROR channel in IRC and asking a few times, and getting no response.  And  €
 €  all this after having to beg to be invited into the channel.  I leech     €
 €  this program, unzip it, find out it's not a game, it's a galaxy making    €
 €  program for looking at stars and shit, and from the size I thought I'd    €
 €  at least get to watch great animations and stuff, but no, the cool stuff  €
 €  was ripped out and I was left with a shell.  I would just like to thank   €
 €  ROR for wasting an ENTIRE night on a piece of shit program.  They could   €
 €  have at least answered my questions rather than ignore an IRC regular     €
 €  and justify their obviously due reputation.  Anways, Entropy, my plea is  €
 €  that if a group is going to release a piece of shit like this, and waste  €
 €  everyone's time, at least warn us or answer when we ask what it is.  I    €
 €  know that some groups may have accidently released programs that are not  €
 €  fully cracked or are missing parts, at least they give us enough of the   €
 €  program to see if we like it enough to warrant buying(ECK!) or getting    €
 €  a fix for it, but there is no excuse for SHIT like this astrology         €
 €  program.  That is about it, I just had to vent my anger at a group that   €
 €  obviously doesn't care about the scene or the people that make it up.     €
 €                                                                            €

 €  P.S. Does ROR stand for Ream our Rumps?                                   €
 €                  Cause it definitely feels that way.                       €

 €      Irritated, you are not alone on this, and I do understand and         €
 €  sympathise with you when things like this happen.  I also hate it         €
 €  when I go and download something that is 30+ disks and to find that       €
 €  it does not work, or that it is not at all what I was expecting, but      €
 €  you also have to remember that you have gotten this software for free.    €
 €  To tell you the truth, I actually thought that software was a game also,  €
 €  but when I saw the 30+ disk part it drew my mind away from even thinking  €
 €  of getting the program.  Now not going back on what I have said before    €
 €  about software for free and please do not complain, I'm human also.  I    €
 €  sometimes would love to go into a group's channel and just start yelling. €
 €  I think that one of the major problems you had was the lack of support    €
 €  from the group that released the program.  ROR has shown me the same      €
 €  attitude when I have had a question to ask.  The people who release the   €
 €  software should also be mature enough to stand behind what they release   €
 €  and give you support when you need it, and not turn their backs on the    €
 €  public that they are releasing for.  And concerning your "Ream Our Rumps" €
 €  statement I persoanlly would like to hear publicly what ROR has to say.   €
 €                                                                            €

 €      I read your "Dear Ent" for the first time in RCN issue 7, I agree     €
 €  with you that virused programs are very easy to fix, since it only takes  €
 €  about 30 seconds to run a scanner, but it is very bothersome cause you    €
 €  don't expect a group to release things with viruses in them, and it came  €
 €  to me as a surprise.  Oh, I don't agree with you on releases that don't   €
 €  work.  I know I downloaded it for free, but it does take a lot of my      €
 €  time.  That's all I gotta say, groups should check their stuff, cause     €
 €  when I download 50+ disk utils from groups, and find out they're fucked   €
 €  up beyond belief, I get PISSED... I mean.. stuff like that shouldn't be   €
 €  happening on the internet.                                                €

 €      Well I do not think that groups intentionally put viruses into their  €
 €  programs.  For all you know the site that they first U/L it to had a      €
 €  virus of some kind and when they were adding the diz or what not, who     €
 €  knows.  The thing is though that it would save time and energy for you    €
 €  to just run that virus scanner than to go into a channel and bitch about  €
 €  something that will ultimatly get you no place but banned from the        €
 €  channel.                                                                  €

 €      50+ disk utils in the first place should not even be released.  If    €
 €  something is that big it must be SO important as you would need to buy    €
 €  the software instead.  I do agree with you again that when things don't   €
 €  work it bugs the crap out of me, but what can you do about it?  Nothing!  €
 €  When groups release something MOST of the time the groups go to great     €
 €  lengths to test a release well before they release the program.           €
 €  Sometimes the release may work perfectly on their computers and not on    €
 €  yours.  Who knows, but MY point is that what are you really gaining by    €
 €  going into a channel and bitching about a program?  Are you trying to     €
 €  show off how K-rad or C00l you are by pissing off a group as much as you  €
 €  can ?  It is stupid and a waste of your time and the group's time.        €
 €  Wouldn't you rather they be spend time on another release and perfecting  €
 €  that then having to put up with whining bullshit from somebody who just   €
 €  spent 2 hours of his life getting a software package for free?!           €
 €                                                                            €
