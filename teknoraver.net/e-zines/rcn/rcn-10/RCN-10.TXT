 €   Hey there... well just to comment on RCN-09.ZIP, I find your attacks on  €
 €   INQ a joke.  Though in my opinion, e-mags aren't very important, just    €
 €   fun to read when you are bored, but between INQ and you, I gotta go      €
 €   with INQ.  Not because they are so much better, but because of the       €
 €   content in RCN.  You treat small, no-name groups as if they are worth    €
 €   mentioning.  We see a million little, crappy internet groups appear and  €
 €   disappear, and nobody cares.  Why?  Because there was no point to them   €
 €   in the first place.  So until you start covering things worth            €
 €   mentioning, besides some no-named couriering group, that I have never    €
 €   seen a file tagged by on PC, XF, or Akira...                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Dear Reader,                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   You know why the scene is filled with so many egoistical people?         €
 €   Because you have to be in a big group to get noticed, and if you're      €
 €   not, you're a "lamer" and aren't worth mentioning.  What these "lamers"  €
 €   tend to do is make their own groups so they can get started in the       €
 €   scene.  That's called ambition, and though it often fails, it deserves   €
 €   recognition.  If you think of yourself as a person more elite than the   €
 €   content of these groups, you should feel good about yourself, it is      €
 €   your level that these groups are trying to reach.  Perhaps greater       €
 €   recognition of these smaller groups will bring more people into the      €
 €   "elite" scene as we know it, and maybe someday yield an awesome          €
 €   supplier or a kick-ass courier to YOUR group.                            €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Reading Issue #7 I notice emphasis on Windows 95.  I thought real men    €
 €   use no Windows 95.  Ar!  Ar!  What gives?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Dear Reader,                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Heheheh, well Windows 95 seems to be the operating environment of the    €
 €   future.  I would refine your hypothesis of real men NOT using Windows    €
 €   95 to "Real men use Windows 95 on a Pentium 100 with 32 megs of RAM and  €
 €   a 2 gig hard drive" - Note that under that hypothesis, I am by no means  €

 €   Dear RCN,                                                                €

 €   I went into #hybrid and there were about 10 people there (maybe I came   €
 €   at a good time, I dunno).  So I asked them to dispel the rumors that     €
 €   they were dead.  They attribute their temporary lack of releases to the  €
 €   post-Christmas season, saying that software companies do not usually     €
 €   release any games after Christmas, as few people would buy them;         €
 €   therefore HBD is also not releasing much during this time.               €
 €                                         -Apprentice  (no affils)           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Dear Reader,                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Again, I hate to use my own group as an example, it always sounds        €
 €   biased, but I'll say this much.  Legacy has had no problems releasing    €
 €   games this year.  Usually the programs we'll find right after Christmas  €
 €   are more like compilations of older games, but nonetheless, they are     €
 €   still store releases.  We still find games that aren't compilations,     €
 €   usually stuff that was hard to crack and groups just skipped, so we'll   €
 €   go in there with our cracking force and try a bit harder the second      €
 €   time around.  Using Christmas as an excuse doesn't work.  There's        €
 €   always more to release.  Pre-Christmas, we find the huge store           €
 €   releases like Warcraft II and the like.  Post-Christmas, we find         €
 €   releases from the smaller companies..                                    €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : In RCN #09, Fallout's interview quoted that you took over #NFS,     €
 €        mass deoped everyone, held #NFS hostage and asked for sites.  Are   €
 €        Fallout's words true?                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, the day before the takeover of #NFS, I received a trojan from   €
 €        someone using the nick tKLP.  This file was called "nbc-t.zip".  I  €
 €        unzipped the program, and ran it assuming that it was a nbc file    €
 €        tagger.  I ran it and poof.  My c: drive went, but I was still      €
 €        able to switch to an mIRC Window because Windows was on my other    €
 €        hard drive.  I then told Fallout that I would be gone for a while   €
 €        because I needed to fix my computer.  I did not log on the Net      €
 €        for two days.  After I had shut off my computer, there was no way   €
 €        to get back into Windows 95 until I got the original CD from my     €
 €        friend Carcnoid.  Carcnoid then asked me if I was online because    €
 €        #Demolition was just taken over by someone called Bullet Wound.  I  €
 €        knew it was not me since my computer was down, so it had to be      €
 €        someone else.  I suspected that the person taking over channels in  €
 €        my name had to be either Phatman or Flake.  Ever since I got on     €
 €        the Net 7 months ago, they have been trying to fuck with me.        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How did you narrow down the suspects to two people, Phatman and     €
 €        Flake?                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I got back on the Net 2 days later, and I saw someone online with   €
 €        my nickname, [-bW-].  I said to the impostor, "FUCK YOU!"  It had   €
 €        to be Flake because he did not have call waiting.  I called Flake   €
 €        on his voice line and asked him why his data line was busy.  He     €
 €        told me his sister was talking on the phone.  I didn't believe him  €
 €        so I got my friend Tranq to 3way 611 and test the line for          €
 €        difficulties, and we found out immediately that it was a modem on   €
 €        the line, not his sister talking with a friend.  Flake was          €
 €        responsible for taking many channels that I am not aware of.        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How did Flake impersonate you to get ops?  Did he have access to    €
 €        your account?                                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, I am using a Cybergate Slip/PPP account to access the Net.      €
 €        From there, I telnet to my shells.  With mIRC, you can change your  €
 €        real name, alias, etc.  Cybergate is also composed of about 5000    €
 €        accounts of wich 4500 are cracked.                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How do you feel about Flake hurting your reputation?                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I have been working hard at getting my reputation back up.          €
 €        Distinct understood that it was not me because they think I was     €
 €        honest or some shit like that.  Demolition believed me with any     €
 €        explanation and Nokturnal Trading Alliance did not really care.     €
 €        The only two groups that cared were aCe and NFS.  Both groups       €
 €        kicked me out and did not seem to want me back.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why do you think that aCe and NFS did not believe your story?       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I really don't know.  I knew Fallout from AKA and I would have      €
 €        though that he would understand.  I guess people from DMN are more  €
 €        understanding.  Besides, why would I take over sooooooo many        €
 €        channels?  What for?  To prove that I am a big man?  I already      €
 €        know I am :) j/k.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is your opinion of Fallout and NFS now that you got kicked     €
 €        out of that group for something you apparently did not do?          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Fallout is cool I guess, and it must really suck for him because    €
 €        take overs suck.  Since he wants me out, that's fine with me, but   €
 €        if he wants me back, it'll also be fine.  I have no personal        €
 €        grudges with him.  He is just trying to make the scene a little     €
 €        better.                                                             €

 €   A  : dCS is another courier group, not just any courier group because    €
 €        we are a group that tries to get shit done while having fun.  dCS   €
 €        was created by a few ex members of DiC.  I was a senior in DiC and  €
 €        I really didn't like the way it was being run.  They were lazy at   €
 €        the time, so Format, Cluster, and I decided to go on our own.  We   €
 €        specialize in couriering and couriering only.                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Was the leadership in the old DiC too much for you guys?  Would it  €
 €        not be easier to reform DiC than to start a new group?              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : To reform DiC at the time would have been impossible because it     €
 €        was too fucked up.  Nobody knew who the leaders were and we didn't  €
 €        even have a site setup.  However, I do NOT hold any grudges at ANY  €
 €        DiC members.                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why has dCS specialized in one area?  Many new courier groups feel  €
 €        that being able to release games, utilities, consoles, code demos,  €
 €        and making art is good because it makes them versatile.             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well we started out as couriers, and we are not dumb, so we are     €
 €        sticking with couriering... and COURiERiNG ONLY!                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Is dCS official couriers for anyone?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We are not official couriers for any groups right now, but we are   €
 €        negotiating with many groups and we do not want to be officials     €
 €        for a group unless they have proven themselves.  We don't want to   €
 €        make any mistakes and rush into things because that's how groups    €
 €        die and we don't wanna do that.                                     €

 €   A  : Since dCS is a new group, we are taking more and more members each  €
 €        day.  Once we get everything organized, we will be making possible  €
 €        cuts.  Couriers must be able to courier at least 150+ megs per      €
 €        week.  We are strictly 0-3 day, no exceptions!                      €

 €   Q  : What are your futrue plans for dCS?  Will DCS ever split off to     €
 €        being a release group?                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : My goal is to insure the survival of dCS.  I plan on molding it     €
 €        into a very respectable group with good hard working members.       €
 €        As for releasing, I do not plan on releasing under dCS.             €

 €   A  : I make sure that all members are satisfied and if anyone needs      €
 €        anything, I always try to help.  Dedication will help us in the     €

 €   Designated Couriering Specialists is definitely something to look into.  €

 €   Q  : Motiv8 is currently going through somewhat of a low point.  I do    €
 €        however see you guys playing well in the release scene.  What is    €
 €        that all about?                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Motiv8 has been known as a popular site and courier group, but it   €
 €        is boring to just  courier so I wanted something new to do and      €
 €        decided releasing would be fun.  We will release more and more as   €
 €        we are one of the oldest NET groups and we can crack.  Many groups  €
 €        release software that must use cdemulator or fakecd.                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Many feel that a courier group that also releases is spreading      €
 €        itself thin.  Do you feel that is the case with Motiv8?             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : That is correct, many of us concentrate on releasing instead of     €
 €        couriering.  We don't concentrate so much yet as we still do both.  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Isn't it better to do a single job well than to do two jobs in a    €
 €        mediocre fashion?  Is Motiv8 a release group or a courier group?    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We are both since we have members that can do both things.  I have  €
 €        been in the scene ever since the c64 days.  Back in those days,     €
 €        groups had many jobs and people like doing more than one thing.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Surely it would be foolish to compare the c64 days to today, would  €
 €        you not agree?                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Many of the good leaders in the scene were around back in the c64   €
 €        days, and use their knowledge from that scene to help the current   €
 €        scene.  Remember that the c64 built the piracy scene of today.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Is it true that the PC scene started the competitive nature?        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes and no.  The PC scene is definitely a branch of their own, but  €
 €        many of the ideas were brought about from other earlier scenes.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will you do in order to get Motiv8 out of it's slump?          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I don't think Motiv8 is in a slump as only new people claim us      €
 €        dead.  We all have our ups and downs.  People must remember that    €
 €        many of the Motiv8ers have been in the scene for many years and     €
 €        they don't see the fun in the same way and therefore they are more  €
 €        lazy.  We will be celebrating our 2 year anniversary very soon.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How long have you been in the scene, and could you give us          €
 €        specific examples of how the c64 scene helped Motiv8 grow?          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I have been in the scene for nearly 13 years and I have learned a   €
 €        lot about group leadership and quality.  I know how to handle ugly  €
 €        situations like group wars.                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Am I sensing a move of Motiv8 more into Releasing and less into     €
 €        Couriering?                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Motiv8 will do a lot more releasing in the future, but we will      €
 €        still courier because it's fun for a lot of the members.            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How did you resolve group wars in the past?                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I killed 2 groups back in the c64 time!  One begged for peace and   €
 €        we split the other one to pieces.  The rest died in a week so it    €
 €        wasn't really a war, just a skirmish.                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are your group killing tactics?                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We killed the group X-Factor by blocking their phone lines and we   €
 €        threatened them with shit.  The rest just cried for peace.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How did you block phone lines?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : At that time, we had friends in the telephone companies and also    €
 €        we could also use an AT&T Card and then just let the phone hang.    €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : NFS has been doing great the past week by releasing software that   €
 €        has helped the scene continually grow.  What has caused such a      €
 €        drastic improvement in NFS?                                         €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : Is it true that one of your game suppliers were kicked out of NFS   €
 €        because they helped supply utils for Outkast?                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : That is not true, we do not have any members who are in Outkast.    €
 €        We have asked them to merge, but have been unsuccessful.  We have   €
 €        not kicked anyone out besides the people who decided to join SNC,   €
 €        Syndicate.                                                          €

 €   Q  : NFS has been putting out a lot of good software.  However, many of  €
 €        them turned out to be "dupes".  For example, SoftRam 96 released    €
 €        this week was actually just SoftRam 95.  What caused such a big     €
 €        blunder, and how will you prevent such blunders in the future?      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, tKLP told us that he too had SoftRam 96, and that NFS should  €
 €        hurry up and release it so we could beat his group, RoR.  I later   €
 €        found out that he set the whole thing up to screw NFS.  We trusted  €
 €        him and paid the price.                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why would a respected person such as tKLP do such a lame thing as   €
 €        sabotaging another group?                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : tKLP did it because he thinks he is all that + more, but he is      €
 €        really just an asshole.  He's already got a really bad reputation.  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will tKLP gain out of hurting NFS?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : He has always acted like an asshole, and he even applied to NFS to  €

 €        what are your future plans for NFS?                                 €

 €   A  : I plan to make NFS rock solid, sort of like Razor, and to stay in   €
 €        the scene for a long time while having fun releasing a lot.         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Since you want NFS to be like Razor, and Razor is a games group,    €
 €        will NFS ever specialize in games only?                             €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : Were you kicked out of fATE last week, or did you willingly leave   €
 €        the group?                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I told Anti Derivative 4 days ago that I was no longer in fATE and  €
 €        I thought he understood that.                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why did you tell him you were no longer in fATE?                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : For many reason, Anti Derivative and g0d were never online to take  €
 €        care of any problems.  Leodlion is one of the most childish people  €
 €        I know on the NET.  There were also too many people in fATE that    €
 €        did nothing for the group.  I also did not like how everytime       €
 €        there was a problem, they would just kick you out of the channel    €
 €        and not allow you to defend yourself.                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : If Anti Derivative and g0d were not online to take care of their    €
 €        many problems, then who did?  How is fATE still alive?              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : In theory, the other seniors did, but that was one of the main      €
 €        problems, not much of things were taken care of.                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why do you think that Leodlion is childish?  He is a married adult  €
 €        with kids.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : His attitude is a real turn off.  He treats people with little or   €
 €        no respect.  Whenever he disagrees with someone, instead of         €
 €        speaking to them rationaly or allowing the other side to defend     €
 €        themselves, he would just kick them out of the channel.  He has     €
 €        done a lot against me.  When I was still in fATE, whenever he       €
 €        realized that I was correct, he would never admit that he was       €
 €        wrong, but he woudl simply ban me.  I felt that as long as I was    €
 €        in fATE, I should never be taken off the bots, much less banned     €
 €        from them.  That is just one example of his many childish ways.     €
 €        He did not like the fact that when I was questioned, that I would   €
 €        defend myself and in turn, question his actions.                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What did you state?                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, I am a very good "Warez Encyclopedia".  I know all the files  €
 €        that have been released.  A Demolition senior came and asked me     €
 €        if "Such and such a program" was already released.  I knew that it  €
 €        was not out yet, but then Leodlion decided to join the              €
 €        conversation.  He started ordering me to log off the Net and call   €
 €        Park Central to dupe check.  The Demolition senior saw no need for  €
 €        it.  I believe that Leodlion is bad for the group; Anti Derivative  €
 €        is not too good either if he cannot take care of his own duties.    €
 €        g0d is fairly stupid also, he tries and takes over #MALiCE a few    €
 €        days ago, and in turn, that irritates MALiCE and then they take     €
 €        over #Fatefiles.                                                    €
 €                                                                            €

 €    Chris Eden, known on the NET as Spyder-X, passed away on the night of   €
 €  December 26, 1995.  Many of us on the NET did not hear about his passing  €
 €  until a few days ago.  For those of us who knew him, it will be hard to   €
 €  see him go.  He was a great coder, but above all, a loyal friend.  I can  €
 €  only recall that not too long ago, he helped me code an application       €
 €  generator for my group, FSW.  He helped me with C++ here, and scripts     €
 €  there.  He was a part of the scene, and he is sincerely missed by many.   €
 €  He was one of the best coders around, proving himself to be versatile in  €
 €  many languages.                                                           €

 €      I would like to dedicate this issue of RCN in memory of Spyder-X.     €
 €  The RCN Staff has decided to grant an "Eden Award" every six months to    €
 €  individuals who prove to be incredibly valuable to the scene.  The        €
 €  nominees for the award will be hand picked from among the best.  On the   €
 €  last Sunday of each month, the RCN Staff will nominate a person into the  €
 €  individual for the "Eden Award", and every year, on June and December,    €
 €  the RCN Staff will pick the new Edener.                                   €

 €  REDMOND, WASHINGTON, U.S.A, 1996 JAN 12 (NB) -- Microsoft Corp.           €
 €  (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Novell Inc. (NASDAQ: NOVL) have announced what may be  €
 €  the largest settlement ever in a software piracy case.  The two software  €
 €  giants said they have reached a settlement with Scott Morris, the         €
 €  operator of the computer bulletin board known as the Assassin's Guild     €
 €  Bulletin Board Service.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  The deal calls for Morris to pay $70,300 in cash and forfeit computer     €
 €  hardware valued at more than $40,000.  Morris also reportedly agreed to   €
 €  assist Microsoft and Novell in their continuing BBS investigations.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €  The Lexington, Kentucky-based Assassin's Guild promoted itself as the     €
 €  worldwide headquarters for two large software pirate groups, Pirates      €
 €  with an Attitude and Razor 1911.                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €  In April 1995 Newsbytes reported that US Marshals and investigators for   €
 €  Microsoft and Novell had raided Morris' residence, charging him with      €
 €  illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted software.  Law       €
 €  enforcement officials said the Assassin's Guild had been offering         €
 €  hundreds of pirated software products for downloading at no charge,       €
 €  including programs published by Microsoft and Novell.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €  US Marshals seized 13 computers, 11 modems, a satellite dish, nine        €
 €  gigabytes of online data and more than 40 gigabytes of offline data       €
 €  dating back to 1992, according to Microsoft.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Jim Lowe, Microsoft corporate attorney, said online piracy is a growing   €
 €  concern for software publishers.  Microsoft has often announced it is     €
 €  committed to put a crimp in pirate operations.                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Both Microsoft and Novell are members of the Business Software Alliance   €
 €  (BSA), an industry alliance formed to promote the growth of the software  €
 €  industry through education and enforcement initiatives.  According to     €
 €  Bob Kruger, director of enforcement at BSA, the Assassin's Guild          €
 €  settlement sends a strong message to pirates. "It sends a clear message   €
 €  to operators of bulletin boards who are illegally distributing            €
 €  copyright-protected software that they will be investigated and sued, or  €
 €  criminally prosecuted."                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Following the raid BSA spokesperson Kim Willard told Newsbytes the        €
 €  pirated software on the Assassin's Guild computers included Microsoft     €
 €  Windows, Novell Netware, Wordperfect word processor software and          €
 €  numerous games and utilities.                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Before the settlement was reached Morris faced potential penalties that   €
 €  included up to $100,000 in fines and up to five years in jail if          €
 €  convicted.                                                                €

 €  In 1994, the last year for which complete figures are available, an       €
 €  estimated $15.2 billion in revenue was lost by the software publishing    €
 €  industry as a result of software piracy, according to the BSA.  The       €
 €  organization estimates that in the US alone 35 percent of the business    €
 €  software in use is pirated, resulting in almost $3 billion in losses to   €
 €  the industry.  Loss figures refer to the retail value of the pirated      €
 €  software if it were purchased legitimately.                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €  The BSA maintains a toll-free hotline to report suspected software        €
 €  piracy and also has an e-mail address for that purpose.  The group can    €
 €  be contacted at 800-688-2721 or software@bsa.org.                         €

 €      The Business Software Alliance (BSA) claims that $15.2 billion in     €
 €  revenue was lost by the software publishing industry as a result of       €
 €  software piracy.  BSA should stand for Bull Shitting Alliance, not only   €
 €  are those figures outrageous, but there is no possible way to derive an   €
 €  accurate numerical figure on how much was pirated.  From my better        €
 €  judgement, and since I do know just a tad about piracy, I would like to   €
 €  say that 80% of pirated software is not even used.  Of the 20% that is    €
 €  pirated, 99% would not have been bought anyways.  For example, I          €
 €  downloaded "Hooves of Thunder" (when it was 0 day), and decided to try    €
 €  out the game.  Not only did I feel the 22 disks was a complete waste of   €
 €  time, but I'm glad I did not shell out the $60 for some stupid ass horse  €
 €  betting game.  If the Bull Shitting Alliance added $30-60 for every       €
 €  time I downloaded a game, then perhaps, $15.2 billion would seem rather   €
 €  small.  I would probably be responsible for downloading a billion or two  €
 €  myself, but I have yet to extract, much less use, any of the software I   €
 €  download.                                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I am ashamed to say this, but I have to admit, I buy software as      €
 €  much as I can afford.  I only bought 2 programs, so don't start flaming   €
 €  me.  I recently purchased Sim Tower and War Craft 2.  Why did I buy Sim   €
 €  Tower?  First off, it was first pirated by Genesis sometime last year,    €
 €  that means that it is OLD, and I don't know where to get OLD warez; and   €
 €  since the game was highly complicated, a manual was a necessity for real  €
 €  game play.  I downloaded War Craft 2, the beta version by Hybrid, and     €
 €  really enjoyed the game, so I decided to shell out the $59.99 and bought  €
 €  the game.  There are many games and utilities that I would like to buy,   €
 €  if I only had the money.                                                  €

 €      It's been a year since I gasped at a file listing full of pirated     €
 €  software;  a year since I sat in front of my computer waiting hours on    €
 €  end for the line to free up so I could connect and see what it was all    €
 €  about;  a year since I flagged my first download just to find that I      €
 €  didn't have enough of this awkward word they called "credits," something  €
 €  I needed to have before I could download some hard core K-rad WaReZ.      €
 €  It's been a year since I logged onto my first warez BBS.  I thought I     €
 €  was the coolest person around, I had access to over 100 megs of software  €
 €  that could have cost me a lot of money!  Aah, yes, those were the lamer   €
 €  days, the days of confusion.  I remember looking through the main menu,   €
 €  not knowing what half the options did, but noticeing something to the     €
 €  nature of "Other BBS #s."  I quickly looked through the list, jotted      €
 €  down all the numbers, and said to myself "WOW!! All these boards, I can   €
 €  get ANYTHING now!"  I then traveled over to the boards on my list,        €
 €  having given up because of that stupid "credits" message that I didn't    €
 €  know what to do about.                                                    €

 €      ATDT2853256... CONNECT 2400... LOGIN: <NEW>... I made my way through  €
 €  the login procedure, entered my real address, being I wasn't too bright,  €
 €  my real phone number, surely the sysop would want to voice validate me,   €
 €  and then I was presented with a new screen.  It asked me to define        €
 €  acronyms.  Hmm... RiSC: <SIMPLE!>.. "Reduced Instruction Set Computing"   €
 €  PWA.. hmm... "Dunno" FSW "Dunno" ACiD "Dunno" NAFTA "North American       €
 €  Free Trade Agreement..."  The list continued, filled mostly with "Dunno"  €
 €  and other ignorant responses.  I was confused when the next day I         €
 €  logged on and was presented with yet another new screen, saying to the    €
 €  liking of "Get the fuck off my board, lamah."  Sheesh, how vulgar!        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I got lucky, I knew something about the Internet, and found out       €
 €  about a "WaReZ Site."  I tried it, and it was amazing, I didn't find      €
 €  any of that weird "credits" word, and leeched all I wanted (meaning       €
 €  everything).  I saw some site lists, got them, and it said to send in     €
 €  some sites for more in return.  Of course, like any other idiot, I        €
 €  sent in some fake sites, just threw in some numbers that looked good.     €
 €  Most of the lists told me to "Get the fuck off my list, lamah," but       €
 €  there were always the dumb ones that sent me something back.  I would     €
 €  anxiously try to connect to every site, most didn't work, and half the    €
 €  ones that did work had directories too hard for me to change to.  I       €
 €  would be left with about 3 working sites after the rest were sifted out.  €
 €                                                                            €

 €      Not a month later, I got a friend of mine with all too much time on   €
 €  his hands to start downloading all the software, and I started a BBS on   €
 €  a brand new $45 Zoltrix no error-correcting or compression 14.4 modem.    €
 €  My friend would upload all the warez that he would get, and the users     €
 €  would download them, free of charge, none of that "credits" bull shit.    €
 €  I learned a lot from that little BBS, that soon became one of the         €
 €  biggest boards in my area, biggest single-node board, that is.  I found   €
 €  out that there were some really nice people that would release software   €
 €  for boards like mine.  Well sure they were nice, you would have to be a   €
 €  really nice person to just spend time sending out software to people!     €
 €  I decided to make a group of my own, Brutus and I, to release some        €
 €  software, kind of help the cause a bit.  Not aware of anything like dupe  €
 €  checking, we just released what we got, most of the stuff was from years  €
 €  before, but we took our coder, Xenon, he coded a nice little EXE for us,  €
 €  and we were off.  Our first release was Telemate 4.20, cracked, which     €
 €  I'll point out we released BEFORE any other group, but it made it no      €
 €  farther than my own area code.  Still, Tsunami, from the late FSW,        €
 €  called Brutus and I up, and asked us to merge into his group.  This was   €
 €  where it all began...                                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €  A look to the bright side:                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Surely we merged, we nearly peed in our pants when we got the offer!  €
 €  I wouldn't say I was lame back then, more ignorant than lame, perhaps     €
 €  unaware would be the best word, but I'll call it lame for now, because    €
 €  I think I was an example of your average "lamer" from today.  I didn't    €
 €  really know about groups, I didn't totally know what they did, I had      €
 €  yet to get on any boards with more than one line, and all I knew about    €
 €  the 'net was that it had FTP sites, I had once tried IRC, I tried to      €
 €  join #warez, but couldn't get in because it was Invite Only, so I just    €
 €  gave up.  When I got into FSW, Tsunami introduced me to IRC, I learned    €
 €  a bit about how to use it, and I was off.  Of course I assumed that I     €
 €  could get into any group now, I was coo like dat, da pimp o' da           €
 €  neighbawhood, I could do ANYTHING!  My position in FSW wasn't really      €
 €  stated yet, I assumed that I would try to get FSW releases, though.  I    €
 €  think Tsunami must have seen that I could lead a group well, something    €
 €  like that, because I was about as confused as, well, a lamer.  I found    €
 €  out that groups actually had channels of their own, they didn't all just  €
 €  hang out in #warez, so I joined #Any_group_I_Could_Think_Of.              €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I soon found out that #warez5 and #warez7 were often open to the      €
 €  public.  I joined the channels just to find a bunch of people begging     €
 €  for new software, nobody really getting what they want, half of them      €
 €  getting kicked out by people that seemed to think hey were better than    €
 €  them, nobody really getting anything done.  Tsunami once found me in one  €
 €  of these channels and told me why I shouldn't hang there, how I would     €
 €  never get anything through them.  I took his advice, thank goodness.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I remember applying to fATE, ZillionZ, PWA, and RTS, not that I knew  €
 €  what I was applying as, not that I really cared.  In fact, I didn't even  €
 €  know what the difference was between a Courier group and a Release        €
 €  group!  When asked what I was applying as, I just said, "Uhh, I guess a   €
 €  distro BBS..." "How many nodes do you have?" "uhhh... 1, but I hope to    €
 €  get a second one within a month, I really do!"  Then I wondered why I     €
 €  got kicked out only a few moments later.  Tsunami knocked some sense      €
 €  into me, taught me exactly how a group ran, what the differences were     €
 €  between groups, and all the tricks of the trade.  I was soon an FSW       €
 €  senior, FSW died, we started Vendetta, I was the vice president, and      €
 €  am now in Legacy as a vice president.  All this started from one small    €
 €  FTP site that didn't push much more than about 5kb/s.                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €  A look back...                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Today, as I join #Warez5, just to think back on old times, I am       €
 €  amazed to see many of the same people I saw there about 9 months ago,     €
 €  still doing what they did then, still getting the same results.  I just   €
 €  don't understand.  Maybe it's my competitive spirit, maybe it's my need   €
 €  for improvement, but it took me no more than 5 months to get from a       €
 €  nobody in the scene to somebody who, in my humble opinion, is doing       €
 €  quite well from himself.  How could these people, who I'm sure have been  €
 €  hanging out in the warez channels for longer than I can imagine, stay     €
 €  there, never improving their status, always staying the same?             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Given the existence of this highly competitive spirit in the scene,   €
 €  if you ever want to get on any of the bigger boards (i.e. the boards      €
 €  that actually have all 20 disks of a 20 disk release) you must give in.   €
 €  Maybe the scene isn't totally free.  Maybe it just requires payment in    €
 €  the form of desire to help.  I'm sure there are many of us that are in    €
 €  the scene so that when there's a program that we need coming out, we can  €
 €  get it, instead of having to shell out a ton of money in buying it.  I'm  €
 €  quite happy with such people, and don't look down at them one bit.  It    €
 €  happens to be that I'm involved in this business to have fun and          €
 €  compete, where they are in it for the software itself.  However, if one   €
 €  wants to be in just to get software, he'll have to put out just a bit.    €
 €  Perhaps on a weekend when he has extra time, wait for a group to release  €
 €  and download the release right away, then send it to the board you want   €
 €  to download from.  All it involves is a bit of dedication.                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The easiest road to success in the scene is joining a group.  You     €
 €  might not feel like you're good enough to join the top groups, but there  €
 €  is a wealth of smaller groups ready to accept new applicants.  Just       €
 €  don't expect to quit the smaller group for a bigger one once you've       €
 €  gotten more experience.  If you join a group, you should be dedicated to  €
 €  it as it should be to you.  The only excuse ever to leave a group is if   €
 €  the group dies, you strongly disagree with the values of the group and    €
 €  talking with the staff doesn't fix anything, or if the group merges       €
 €  into another.  You should spend as much time choosing your group as they  €
 €  should evaluating you for a position.  Just remember, this is all for     €
 €  fun, we're not in here to make money, or to fill egos.                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      For those of us that aren't in it for the software or the             €
 €  competition, I often wonder why we stay.  What's the point of staying in  €
 €  the scene if all you do all day is beg, beg, and beg some more, never     €
 €  getting any of what you ask for.  The scene is one big cycle.  The        €
 €  leaders of today may retire tomorrow.  The members of yesterday will      €
 €  lead today, and the "lamers" of last night will take the place of the     €
 €  members today.  I could never stay a lamer forever.  The only thing that  €
 €  I fear is that our "lamers" aren't really lame, just uneducated, and      €
 €  they don't know HOW to excel in the scene.  We all must start somewhere.  €
 €  Some of us, like myself, got lucky, and had an early chance, but for      €
 €  the group leaders out there, beware, the last person you kicked out of    €
 €  your channel for having a 1-node board might possibly be your             €
 €  competition's next store supplier or multi-node courier.                  €
 €                                                                            €

 €  courier group review for 1996!                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      This issue I will be rating Courier groups.  Couriers play perhaps    €
 €  one of the most vital roles in the scene, yet they are probably the       €
 €  least regarded.  Without couriers to spread our warez across the world    €
 €  with great speed, possibly there would be no 'scene' as we know it.       €
 €                                                                            €

 €      The first courier group I will be commenting on is RiSC (Rise in      €
 €  Superior Couriering), exactly what they are, superior.  RiSC has had the  €
 €  most superb courier team since the very beginning.  They display their    €
 €  unparallelled ability to the scene on a daily basis.  I have personally   €
 €  witnessed the amazing speed and gumption of a RiSC trader while leeching  €
 €  <grin> off of a RiSC distro site named "The Shallow Grave."  At the       €
 €  time, the SysOps of this blazing 4 node board were Lord Rook and Gate     €
 €  Keeper.  I first came to this BBS on a recommendation from a friend.      €
 €  When I got on this board I was truly amazed at the size and speed of it.  €
 €  Supplied by RiSC trader 'The Technomancer,' this was the fastest site I   €
 €  had ever been on.  In the two months I was on this board, Techno had      €
 €  pumped in over 2.4 gigs of fast warez.  I had a chance to talk to Techno  €
 €  a few times and he explained that being in a group like RiSC, almost      €
 €  demanded that he be the best, whether relying on personal ambition or     €
 €  not, Techno defined RiSC, to me, as the best couriering group in the      €
 €  world!                                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Now let me rate RiSC.  Although they definately do their job and do   €
 €  it very well, they are hard to find.  In my 'career' on the net and in    €
 €  the PC scene, I have never heard of or seen a RiSC site, or a dedicated   €
 €  channel on IRC.  This, to me, means they have a mail recruit system       €
 €  which, as I've expressed in the past, is not a good way to get in touch   €
 €  with the majority of warez people.  I do realize that most RiSC members   €
 €  are in PWA and DOD, but I am sure that a lot of others don't know this    €
 €  and have no idea how to apply.  So, my rating for RiSC is a 9.5.  A       €
 €  better recruiting system would benefit the group as a whole and the       €
 €  boards they supply.                                                       €
 €                                                                            €

 €      The next group I will be rating is fATE.  fATE is the product of two  €
 €  groups that merged about a year ago: TiC and iLA.  I was a member of TiC  €
 €  at the time of the merger, formerly known as Vendetta.  TiC was headed    €
 €  at the time by Red Dog, an outstanding leader with tremendous couriering  €
 €  ability.  Since the merger, Red Dog has moved from Senior to net courier  €
 €  and now to nothing.  He left fATE around Christmas of 1995 (I am told)    €
 €  for reasons unknown to me.  This I feel is one of fATE's major problems.  €
 €  They seem to have lost their sense of direction and organization.  This   €
 €  being sparked by Red Dog's departure from fATE and his diminishing        €
 €  contribution to fATE.  I am not blaming all of fATE's problems on Red     €
 €  Dog, in fact just the opposite.  Red Dog was an awesome leader.           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Despite all of fATE's problems with organization and the power        €
 €  struggles within fATE, they have assembled one of the best teams on the   €
 €  net today.  They keep their sites full, and continually keep other        €
 €  courier groups on their toes.  They have out-tagged other courier groups  €
 €  3 to 1 on the net, and are doing great in that department.  So, my        €

 €      RTS in its earlier days was a feirce competitor of RiSC.  RTS was     €
 €  one of the top courier gropus around, with lightning-fast traders and a   €
 €  superb council that certainly gave direction to the group.  Around early  €
 €  1995, RTS was said to have died, as a mutual decision between senior      €
 €  members of RTS.  Since mid to late 1995, RTS had once again emerged in    €
 €  the scene with a great internet staff as well as telecom staff.  The old  €
 €  days of RTS are h ere again, and kicking ass!                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      RTS, as I said before, has assembled a great couriering team.  With   €
 €  couriers from well established groups such as MALiCE, RiSC, and others.   €
 €  I see a great team here with perserverance and strong leadership, and an  €
 €  able staff to once again be a top couriering gropu.                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €      On occasion I go through different channels to see what's going on,   €
 €  and I always seem to bump into an RTS courier no matter where I'm at,     €
 €  and they are always ofering RTS's application and several loaders.  This  €
 €  is a fantastic way of recruiting new members.  They show their            €
 €  experience in their versatility, and in my opinion, will rise to          €
 €  greatness (again) and perhaps the next RiSC.  My rating for RTS, a solid  €
 €  9.5.  Everything is there, they just need a bit of re-establishment.      €

 €      Mindcrash has had a year to show its stuff to date, picking up        €
 €  Legacy as their official coueriers, and having a second wind so to        €
 €  speak, in the scene.  MC has worked hard at their job, and has earned     €
 €  the respect of top courier groups.                                        €

 €      When MC first began, it was a small couriering group with little      €
 €  known presence and very few affiliations.  MC has had a slow start in     €
 €  the scene but is doing great!  I've had the pleasure of watching their    €
 €  popularity grow as their NFO grows.  I must admit, even I thought MC      €
 €  would fail in the early stages of its birth, but behind its strong        €
 €  leader, The Wicked One, it has emerged to be a great group.  My rating    €
 €  for Mindcrash so far is 7.8.  They have a great team, with great          €
 €  leadership and support, they just need to work on their speed and         €
 €  'presence.'                                                               €

 €      My last review will be of MALiCE.  MALiCE is one of the strongest     €
 €  groups in the scene right now, with some of the fastest traders ever,     €
 €  such as Winterhawk, and 187.  MALiCE has been compared to the early days  €
 €  of RiSC, and is said to have one of the best couriering team ever         €
 €  assembled.  The sheer determination and efficiency of this group has      €
 €  pushed them to the top, and their popularity grows almost on a daily      €
 €  basis.                                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      MALiCE has had a great year so far and is continuing to dominate the  €
 €  couriering scene among the newest releasers and traders.  What I mean by  €
 €  new is the newly established groups, such as Legacy, Motiv8, and others.  €
 €  MALiCE doesn't seem to respect other groups, or potential applicants      €
 €  that much, though.  When I entered their channel on an invite, I was      €
 €  abruptly kicked by Pericles with the reason "And you are...,"  this       €
 €  shows me that their rise to startum and dominance over other groups has   €
 €  gone directly to their heads.  In my opinion, this is not a good way to   €
 €  handle people who are interested in the group.  I just don't think they   €
 €  have respect for people, which is a major problem when recruiting.  So,   €
 €  my rating for MALiCE is a 7.  They have great couriering ability, but     €
 €  lack respect and patience, which, as proven in the past, can be           €
 €  disasterous.                                                              €
 €                                                                            €

 €      To recap, RiSC has accomplished everything possible, nothing less.    €
 €  fATE has the potential to rank with the best, they just need to plant     €
 €  their feet on the groupd, and hold on.  RTS is a great group with         €
 €  tremendous will and awareness towards the scene, hang in there guys!      €
 €  Mindcrash is slowly rising to the top with great leadership and a well    €
 €  balanced staff, and MALiCE has one of the best couriering teams in the    €

 €      When a dupe occurs, the group usually gets put down and often         €
 €  often receives a lot of flak from the public even if the release was a    €
 €  mistake.  Groups that purposely go out of their way to dupe should go     €
 €  down because they don't deserve to be in the scene.  However, if it's a   €
 €  new group and they do they're own release or rip and didn't know it had   €
 €  already been released than that's ok it's a mistake and in most cases     €
 €  the public just gets another chance to get a cool file.  As long as the   €
 €  the group that duped acknowledges their mistake and gives the credit of   €
 €  the release to the original group, then the group that duped should be    €
 €  left alone.                                                               €

 €  was a mistake on our part because we did not know that Legacy already     €
 €  released a 4 disk rip of CivNet (which still includes the modem play).    €
 €  I didn't find out about it until 45 minutes after I started offering the  €
 €  files.  We thought we were bettering the scene and we were.  The file     €
 €  was leeched over 250 times.  I apologized to individual members of        €
 €  Legacy and to the whole group.  Legacy was quick to forgive us, and       €
 €  here's a quote from Rebel Chicken in a private conversation we had the    €
 €  day of the dupe :                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €  "For all I care, DiC helped the scene.  There were a lot of people who    €
 €  were looking for the 4 disk rip from Legacy, so DiC helped put it back    €
 €  in circulation.  Duping is not good, but it's not THAT BAD either.  As    €
 €  long as you give credit to the original group that released it, then it   €
 €  is fine with me.  I don't see why everyone is going out of their way to   €
 €  diss DiC."                                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      If and when a group accidentily dupes don't be so harsh and critical  €
 €  of them just tell them of their mistake and they'll do just like I did    €
 €  apologize and acknowledge their error and everyone can move on to more    €
 €  important stuff, like the next release.  If the file that was duped was   €
 €  popular with the public anyways, then over all that release helped make   €
 €  a lot of people happy.  People who play the game wouldn't really care if  €
 €  it came from Legacy or DiC, and both versions helped the scene over all.  €
 €                                                                            €

 €      I have learned over the past week that the Hybrid leaders are NOT     €
 €  leeching off the government of the United States.  From my sources, a     €
 €  Razor member and friend, I have confirmed that at least one of the        €
 €  Hybrid leaders are leeching off of the Canadian welfare system, NOT the   €
 €  American government.  So all that stuff I said about Bob Dole and Newt    €
 €  Gingrich turned out to be irrelevant.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Again, this is all circumstantial and I only have the word of one     €
 €  person.  Even though that person is very trustworthy and reliable,        €
 €  errors can happen.  All I can say is that, if the Hybrid leaders really   €
 €  are on welfare, they're doing a damn good job of it.                      €

 €      First of all, Darkside left MALiCE, and joined RiSC, supposedly       €
 €  because of access to LA.  The story for Darkside is cut and dry.  I       €
 €  wouldn't call him a traitor or hate him.  When we join  groups it is a    €
 €  voluntary thing and we don't pledge our lives or loyalty to one group.    €
 €  It is kind of like jobs, when you find a better job, you quit your        €
 €  current job and go on to something better.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €      According to sources, Winterhawk wanted to get a list of IP's from    €
 €  HR (net coord for MALiCE), but he refused to give them to Winterhawk.     €
 €  Winterhawk wanted the IP #'s so that she can add them to some site and    €
 €  help Manhunter set-up accounts for people on sites.  Whatever dialog      €
 €  actually occured between HR and Winterhawk is unknown, but Winterhawk     €
 €  compared HR to a Hitler/dictator.  She believed that HR wanted complete   €
 €  Is, who gets added and so on, and didn't want to share his job or have    €
 €  any help from her.  At this point HR, already being on a brink of         €
 €  leaving, decided that he had enough and decided to leave.  I would like   €
 €  to repeat : HR was ALREADY tired of the way things were working out for   €
 €  him in MALiCE and Winterhawk was just a minute reason to leave.           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I would like to say that none of the parties should be blamed for     €
 €  anything.  Winterhawk is more than happy to have HR back in MALiCE, and   €
 €  HR is NOT joining another group, and MAY get back to MALiCE after he      €
 €  calms down or there are some changes in MALiCE.                           €
 €                                                                            €

 €      There seems to be a little conflict between members of MALiCE but I   €
 €  sincerely doubt that would effect the group as a whole.  MALiCE is an     €
 €  incredibly solid group, with good leadership in general.  MALiCE has      €
 €  proven itself to be one of the biggest courier groups even though it is   €
 €  much younger than many groups.  If discipline of members do turn out to   €
 €  be a major problem for MALiCE, I have complete faith that MALiCE would    €
 €  then remedy the situation, and would continue to be one of the best and   €
 €  most efficient of courier groups in the scene.                            €

 €      I have been complaining about the rise of too many groups for weeks   €
 €  now.  The problem isn't as big any more, probably partially due to the    €
 €  fact that there are less releases now that the year has ended.  I have    €
 €  seen more and more couriering groups as opposed to release groups, which  €
 €  I will blame on the fact that it is often harder to coordinate a release  €
 €  group because there is more to worry about.  Note that that in no way     €
 €  applies to the top couriering groups, who I'm sure have more work on      €
 €  their hands than release groups.  I think that in general, though the     €
 €  main reason for having so many new groups flourish is that people aren't  €
 €  satisfied with their current position in a group, or, more specifically,  €
 €  aren't getting the respect that they expect when they are a part of a     €
 €  team.  So I ask...  "What should it feel like to be a member of a         €
 €  group?"                                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €      When a member applies, he is usually greeted by a not-so-friendly     €
 €  crowd that somehow feels bigger than him.  This is all egos, and I don't  €
 €  expect that to end, because after all, we're all human.  The applicant    €
 €  will often spend in the range of thirty to sixty minutes waiting to get   €
 €  the application generator or just a flat out "no" response.  If the       €
 €  applicant was lucky enough to experience the first, he'll promptly fill   €
 €  out the application and look for someone to send it to.  As soon as that  €
 €  application is sent in, the prospective member has literally signed a     €
 €  pact saying that he will be dedicated to the specific group.  This is     €
 €  what many group leaders never seem to understand, and is the point where  €
 €  the member will either serve the group, always feeling lowly, or will     €
 €  join, feel big for a bit, then run off and make his own group because     €
 €  he wasn't getting the respect he felt he deserved.                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I'm surprised that I have to say this, but a member is the most       €
 €  crucial thing to a group.  The leadership often doesn't understand that,  €
 €  and assumes the member to be a slave that must complete his task for      €
 €  fear of being flogged.  A member should have much say in the group.  The  €
 €  only difference between a senior and a member should be that a senior is  €
 €  there to coordinate, as opposed to a member which is there to provide.    €
 €  Two completely different jobs, neither of which should take an excessive  €
 €  precedence over the other.  A senior position, if the particular group    €
 €  even has one, is just a position given to somebody that would like to     €
 €  coordinate that has much experience in the group, possibly been with it   €
 €  from the start.  What's even worse is when there's a group that has not   €
 €  just a council, but a Founder, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Seniors,      €
 €  Head Honchos, Division Honchos, and THEN members, assuming there's        €
 €  anybody left.  I don't know about you, but being a member in that kind    €
 €  of group wouldn't feel too good.  That leads me to believe that it is     €
 €  often better to be a member in a "normal" group than to be a senior in    €
 €  one with such a variety of positions.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €      A member is a vital person in a group.  Members need to get more      €
 €  respect in the scene, and begin to have a greater say in the activities   €
 €  of the group.  We are often confused when we see members leave groups,    €
 €  and we assume that the member just wasn't dedicated, but this is often    €
 €  not the case.  To all leaders : put yourselves in the position of a       €
 €  member sometimes, and think to yourself "If I were this guy, would I be   €
 €  getting the respect that I need?  Would I have any power in what goes on  €
 €  in the group that I have dedicated myself to?"  If either of your         €
 €  answers is no, it's time to make some changes in the structure of your    €
 €  group.                                                                    €

 €                                                                            €
 €      I have noticed a certain trend in the scene lately.  It is a trend    €
 €  that is not beneficial for anyone.  Stealing members.  Now, competition   €
 €  is good, but this is not.  We all know who it is that is on the constant  €
 €  lookout for suppliers and couriers to steal.  In #Legacy, we are always   €
 €  on the lookout for tKLP.  Why?  Because everyone knows that the instant   €
 €  they enter the channel, they will be looking for the best suppliers and   €
 €  becoming their "Friends."  For most of us, these attempts are totally     €
 €  obvious, but for some of us, we fall into the trap and end up in a        €
 €  different group.                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I was in #Legacy, minding my own business, when all of a sudden,      €
 €  tKLP was messaging me saying "Zup Buddy!?"  I thought to myslef: "Have I  €
 €  talked to him before?  He's being awful friendly..."  Knowing that he     €
 €  was probably going to ask me to leave Legacy, I played along.  He said    €
 €  "I've heard you're a pretty impressive supplier."  And I said "Sure, I    €
 €  guess so.  I supply for Legacy a lot."  The next message I received read  €
 €  as follows: "Could I interest you in a RoR membership?"  My answer was a  €
 €  simple "No."  I fear that others, possibly from other groups, will have   €
 €  a different answer.  Unfortunately, if tKLP is the one that's asking,     €
 €  they'll end up in a group they'd probably rather not be in.               €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Everyone knows that this is not the first time tKLP has done this.    €
 €  It didn't hurt anyone this time, because there's no way in hell that I'd  €
 €  join RoR.  The point is, if your group is not good enough to compete,     €
 €  don't go stealing other group's suppliers.  It's bad sportsmanship, and   €
 €  it's bad public relations.                                                €

 €      I am very disappointed in you Entropy.  When I get ops in #Ansi, I    €
 €  feel that I have a job to do.  I kick and ban people that I feel are      €
 €  lame.  It doesn't mean that I feel all powerful, it just means that I     €
 €  have a job to do, and that involves kicking out lamers.  Ops is NOT       €
 €  simply a bunch of pixels as you put it.  You can compare Ops to IRCOPs,   €
 €  it's not just a bunch of pixels either, it gives you power, and I choose  €
 €  to exercise that power in a legitimate way.  If that makes me look like   €
 €  a pompous ass, then so be it.                                             €

 €    Yes we all know by now that AOL has provided a link to the IRC for all  €
 €  of the AOL'ers to flock to our homes, for months on end, people have      €
 €  been stereotyping AOL as lame.  If you looked at how many bans there are  €
 €  on aol.com, it is a pitiful sight.  Are the bans necessary, are all AOL   €
 €  people lame?  I say no.  What is bad about people from another online     €
 €  service comeing to help spread our warez around and help us?  Nothing.    €
 €  Are we trying to set back the IRC Civilization to that of the early 19th  €

 €  them all?  If so, you're an "Idiot".  AOL is a cheap and in most cases,   €
