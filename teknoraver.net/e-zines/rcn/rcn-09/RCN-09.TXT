 €   Throughout these past 8 issues, Reality Check Network has received       €
 €   a great amount of user response.  The RCN staff has decided to publish   €
 €   these comments, whether supportive or destructive.  We would like to     €
 €   encourage our readers to continue to voice their opinions, and we would  €

 €           This is concerning the FBI Interview.  I swear, you fools        €
 €   probably just saved my ass.  I am running an 8 node board, the board is  €
 €   invite only, and I often let people on straight out of IRC.  Maybe I     €
 €   was just stupid, but I have never asked anybody if he's FBI or not, and  €
 €   even after I let them on the board, there is no disclaimer.  If I had    €
 €   kept that up, I don't doubt that sooner or later I'd be sitting behind   €
 €   bars.  That interview was very informative, and I'm glad you did it.     €
 €   Thanks a million!                                                        €

 €           You're exactly the reason why we did that interview.  The scene  €
 €   has been around so long that it seems as if we've become overly calm.    €
 €   We have to remember that what we're doing is, after all, grossly         €
 €   illegal.  We are lucky that it's not very hard to catch us, but if we    €
 €   become too calm, the FBI WILL catch up with us.                          €

 €   Q  : DiC lasted about a week, what happened?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, actually about 2 weeks ago we reached kind of a stop, no one  €
 €        was doing anything and there was a lot of bickering but we were     €
 €        still couriering.  Then one night I went to bed and during the      €
 €        night I learned the next day that the group broke up, I was told    €
 €        that griffon did it.  So I was angry for a while but now I realize  €
 €        I should have just kept it going then because it was a good group   €
 €        with good presence, it's harder now that we're starting over, but   €
 €        I'm determined to do well this time.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How will you approach DiC differently his time?                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I'm focusing on carefully hand picking the people I had in the      €
 €        group.  I'm picking on loyalty, skill, and dedication to trading    €
 €        and artwork.  The group is classified as warez and art oriented. I  €
 €        am even considering putting out an art pack each month.  We have    €
 €        quite a few people already for art and a few other have potential.  €
 €        One even did a picture for Razor!                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So if a person has experience in a group such as Razor, or other    €
 €        big groups, they will have a higher chance of getting in the new    €
 €        DiC?  How will you better hand pick them?  How will you determine   €
 €        loyalty?  What measures will you use?                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I will use trial periods to see how they perform.  Yes, if someone  €
 €        has done artwork or couriering for Razor, they have got to be       €
 €        pretty good, and I'll probably give them a little more leeway than  €
 €        others that want to join.  I'm not accepting any newbies, I don't   €
 €        have time to babysit and there will be no put downs in the group.   €
 €        If someone isn't performing they will be told in private by me to   €
 €        up their standards or resign.                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is your opinion on taggings?  For all new groups, it must be   €
 €        very hard to find things to tag.  Will DiC turn to strip tagging    €
 €        or double tagging?                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I will not double tag!  I hate double tagging.                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Will DiC courier files NOT tagged by DiC?                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I hope we become official couriers for PSH or some other group so   €
 €        we can tag their files.  If we get files that have tags from other  €
 €        courier groups, we'll probably just add our nfo file and may be a   €
 €        small loader, it seems only fair that way.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : If a person from MALiCE joins DiC, will they have to leave MALiCE?  €
 €        Most major courier groups have rules stating that their members     €
 €        can only be in one courier group.                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : That's a tough decision.  It will depend on how well it effected    €
 €        their performance.  I would have to ask them to choose.             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How do you compare DiC with the established courier groups such as  €
 €        RiSC, MALiCE, fATE, and MC?                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : In order to make Domination In Couriering prominent, we will first  €
 €        have to compare ourselves with smaller groups like Release on       €
 €        Rampage and C.O.P.S before we can hope to be compared to fATE.      €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : Why was the PRESIDENT of RoR, tKLP, kicked out of RoR?              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : He has always been on a mission to undermine other groups.  All he  €
 €        is, is a title.  He doesn't give a shit for the group's future.  I  €
 €        spend all my time undoing his messes with people all over the net.  €
 €        I can't keep doing that.  RoR has great potential to be a major     €
 €        release group but tKLP only does what he wants, like a spoiled      €
 €        baby.                                                               €

 €   Q  : How was tKLP kicked out of RoR?                                     €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How long did it take you to conspire the plan of taking over RoR?   €
 €        Or was it done spontaneously at a moment's notice?                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We did not conspire, we made a business desision, that would be     €
 €        best for the group.  I don't want this to seem like we are being a  €
 €        bunch of young kids or vandels.  We just worked so hard at making   €
 €        this group work that we needed to hold on to something for our      €
 €        efforts.  It was apparent tKLP did not care for the group.  So we   €
 €        decided to keep the group, and kick him.  There's something wrong   €
 €        with TKLP, he thinks he's some sort of god because he ran a group.  €
 €        All he wanted to do was release everything and anything he could    €
 €        get his hands on.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Who will run RoR now that tKLP is gone?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : My concern is to show people that we can be a TRUE player in the    €
 €        scene, not a group that stands alone and fucks with everybody.      €
 €        I'm not like that and I respect the scene too much for that.        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Was there a lot of trouble when tKLP was kicked out?  Were there    €
 €        members that stuck with tKLP?                                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : He didn't get the name "The Crazy Little Punk" for no reason.  I    €
 €        expect there to be some trouble, but this was done more as a        €
 €        statement.  We don't even want the name RoR because it's banned     €
 €        off of most boards anyways.  I tried to make RoR good while he      €
 €        just went around screwing over the group.                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So instead of taking over RoR, you're splitting away from the       €
 €        group, and starting a new one?                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We will most likely split off, why would I want the name RoR?  I    €
 €        just wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine.                €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have currently released nothing but we are scheduled to release  €
 €        tomorrow.  We will most likely be making 2 or 3 releases tomorrow   €
 €        or the next day!                                                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How can you say that you have a strong foundation if you have yet   €
 €        to release?                                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We currently have 3 BBSs allied with us.  Each of them are 4 nodes  €
 €        or more.  2 of them are known very well.  We also have developed    €
 €        a strong couriering section!                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : You are a release group, what about suppliers?                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, currently we have 2 strong suppliers.  Myself and Major       €
 €        Access.  One of my co-council members, Lucid, will soon be able     €
 €        to supply for us as well.                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What is going to set you apart from any of the other loser groups   €
 €        that end up dying?                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have a strong council run by myself, Lucid, and Lax.  We also    €
 €        make it a point to keep in touch with each other when not on IRC    €
 €        via telephone.                                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are your prior affils?                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, I was affiliated with fATE in the past under another nick,    €
 €        MaDDog, as a courier.                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Were you ever affiliated with any release groups?                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, I was not, but I have many connections to supply EXiLE with!    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What makes you think that you will know how to run a release        €
 €        group?                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well my prior experience in the scene and the way that I have       €
 €        watched and monitored other heads of groups, I feel I am            €
 €        qualified!                                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Why are you deciding to release both games and utils as opposed to  €
 €        just one?                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have resources to both Apps and Games, so we decided that we     €
 €        would release both apps and games until we establish ourselves as   €
 €        either a games group or an apps group.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : In my opinion, there are too many groups in the scene right now.    €
 €        Why did you not just join another group instead of starting yet     €
 €        another?                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, one of the main reasons we started a group was because of     €
 €        the challenge involved and because we felt that we were capable of  €
 €        making an excellent releasing group.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will you do to keep from having dupes and uncracked releases?  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We would never dupe.  To prevent this from happening we check all   €
 €        release lists put out and we always ask around to be sure.  Also,   €
 €        we would never make a release unless it was cracked.  That ruins    €
 €        the point of releasing at all!                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Are you on any big boards so you can dupe check if you lost a       €
 €        release within a short time period?                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Both of my co's are on Akira and some other major boards.  The      €
 €        only boards I am on are No-man's land and Maleviolence!             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What will set EXiLE apart from the rest of the competition?         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Our strong leadership and our connections to the rest of the        €
 €        scene.  We are also a very hard working group!                      €
 €                                                                            €

 €   Q  : From the name of your group, NFS (Need for Speed), I assume it is   €
 €        a courier group.  What areas does NFS specialize in?                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : NFS is a release group, I got the name from a game.  I thought it   €
 €        was cool.                                                           €

 €   Q  : Does NFS specialize in releasing games or utilities?                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Right now, we are going to release anything, utils, apps, games,    €
 €        cracks, SNES, and consoles too.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Would such diversity in releasing help the group's image? Since     €
 €        you guys release anything?                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, I heard from people that consoles are very big in Europe.  I   €
 €        would also like to get our name out on everything.                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are some of the best NFS releases?                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Realms of Chaos and Iceman's Apprentice were awesome.  Iceman was   €
 €        kind of lame, but Sweden liked it.  It didn't seem English, but it  €
 €        was, and it helped get our name out there.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Realms of Chaos was nuked off of all major boards because it was a  €
 €        dupe.  What will make NFS different and better in the future?       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, we try to cater to everyone's needs, and we try to be nice.   €
 €        Some lamers take advantage of that.  We are working hard on being   €
 €        quality and quantity, but not assholish.  Bullet Wound, our senior  €
 €        cracker, decided to turn into an asshole one day, he mass deoped    €
 €        everyone, and asked me to hand over the sites.  I gave him nothing  €
 €        and kicked him out of the group.  We tried to be nice, but he       €
 €        KNEW we don't have a site up yet.                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Was Bullet Wound a spy?                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I am not sure, he is in DTC and DMN though.  Philter's a really     €
 €        lame, he likes to impersonate group leaders.  He came up to me as   €
 €        Philter on his account philter@xmission.com and said to me,         €
 €        "I'll impersonate you!"  He impersonated Anti Derivative, TKLP,     €
 €        and even me.  He would give people DCC requests for the file        €
 €        "nbc-t.zip".  I had auto-get on, so I got the files automatically.  €
 €        My friend, Red Dog, tried the file, and to his horrible discovery,  €
 €        his hard drive got formated.  We tried tracking Philter, and he     €
 €        said, "You should try impersonating!  It's fun!"  He thinks I like  €
 €        him, but I don't.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €

 €   A  : I never understood about groups before.  Now I do.  I figured out   €
 €        that what I did before didn't really work.  MTV (Money is too       €
 €        Valuable), was my first group, and then BMP (Bite Me Productions),  €
 €        they were not too elite, but it helped NFS because I picked up      €
 €        about 3 members from there.                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What have you learned from your past groups?                        €

 €   A  : It's hard being a leader, because you have to bust your ass off.    €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Let's start with some Rebels history, when did it all start?        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : It's a long story, the group started in 1984 as an amiga demo       €
 €        group.  We became one of the biggest demo groups in the world of    €
 €        that time.  Rebels Amiga still exsists but is not run by the same   €
 €        management team.  We no longer have anything to do with them.       €
 €        There is also a Rebels C64 division somewhere in France.  We have   €
 €        no contact with either of them.  Rebels PC was started in the       €
 €        beginning of 1990 by Met and I.                                     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Who came with the cool slogan "We make all days party days"?        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : It was something that came up one night many years ago when Rebels  €
 €        was still only an amiga demo group.  Met and some other guys from   €
 €        Rebels was having a small party at one of a member's house.  They   €
 €        were all dead drunk.  It sounds good, life is a party.  So we have  €
 €        kept it ever since.                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are the requirements to become a Rebels supplier?              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We currently have 15 members in Rebels, all of them except one are  €
 €        located in Sweden, and nearly all of them supply in one way or      €
 €        another.  We try to keep the best quality in our releases, but      €
 €        sometimes low quality releases gets released by mistake.  That is   €
 €        something we have discussed a lot the past few weeks.  We must      €
 €        hold a release one day and check that everything works instead of   €
 €        just releasing it as soon as we get our hands on it.  We have put   €
 €        Mercury and Ivanhoe up as seniors, they will check things that Met  €
 €        and I do not have time for.                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : I saw a game being released by Rebels a few weeks ago.  I thought   €
 €        Rebels released only utilities.  Are Rebels going to be competing   €
 €        in the game scene as well?                                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Caffer, who released it is not even in rebels.  We only release     €
 €        utilities, we will NOT release games.  If anyone sees a game by     €
 €        Rebels, NUKE IT!!!                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How big is Rebels?                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Everyone in Rebels is doing this as a hobby and we don't have much  €
 €        pressure.  So I think we are doing very well.  We have been among   €
 €        the top 10 groups for some time now, and before Pantera and Corp    €
 €        started to release as much as they do today, we were among the top  €
 €        5 groups.                                                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Do you think it is harder for a group to become established if      €
 €        the group comes from a small country like Sweden?                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Yes, but I think it is good that almost everyone in Rebels comes    €
 €        from the same country and even the same city.  Our friendship is    €
 €        much better than other groups.  We often get together to have a     €
 €        good time without being in front of the computer.                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Where is the Rebels' WHQ located?                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have had a whole lot of boards in Rebels history, many HQ's and  €
 €        member boards, but we understood that we didn't needed that many    €
 €        boards.  We will never have time to call them as often as we want   €
 €        to.  Anyways, we want boards where we can call and contact each     €
 €        other.  Therefore, we decided to have ONLY two baords.  It was      €
 €        Digital Extortion as WHQ and Masturbation Station as USHQ, both     €
 €        with telnet.  There, we could always get in touch with each other   €
 €        and with people that were intrested in Rebels, but Digital          €
 €        Extortion closed.  We realized that we needed a board in Sweden     €
 €        where we could get new nfo's and so on, just a couple of days ago,  €
 €        we took System one as WHQ (big board in sweden).                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Does Rebels have an official FTP Site HQ?                           €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We have one unofficial FTP HQ.  It's mostly for the couriers so     €
 €        that they can get the releases fast.                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Does Rebels have an official couriers group?                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : MALiCE is our official courier group. It is working flawlessly.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : How about REBELS on IRC, I can't say Rebels is noticed there.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I agree, we have not been active on IRC, but that is something we   €
 €        really are working on.  We also have our own e-mail address and a   €
 €        mailbox so you could get in contact with us there also.             €
 €                                                                            €

 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Viper is a courier group, but not an ordinary courier group.  We    €
 €        do more then just move warez, we also decode, and code, do art and  €
 €        vga's, and we call long distance.                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Who makes up ViPER?                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, we have many couriers that have big backrounds, some from     €
 €        MALiCE and fATE, a few from RiSC, and some from dead groups that    €
 €        died in 1995.  We would like to recruit only the best in couriers   €
 €        and coders and artists.  Therefore, we are very selective.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What are the requirements for one to join Viper?                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : The requirements for couriers are that they must have 1 year worth  €
 €        of internet couriering experience, previous affiliations and        €
 €        references are checked.  Artists must have at least 2 years doing   €
 €        computer art, with accountable artwork and samples.  Coders must    €
 €        be able to code in C or Pascal, and must have a minimum of 2 years  €
 €        programming demos.  I have not yet required Assembly as a factor,   €
 €        but the ViPER application does mention it.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : MALiCE, RiSC, and fATE require that their members be in only ONE    €
 €        courier group.  ViPER is also a courier group, is there noticeable  €
 €        conflicts of interest?                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : No, I believe that being in more then 1 Group is a better way to    €
 €        get experience couriering in the internet world, but if the two     €
 €        groups conflict (duty) wise, then i will ask the person to switch   €
 €        to a diffrent duty or make a choice between the two groups.         €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : What makes ViPER different from other groups?                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We call long distance, and we can decode files.  For example, if    €
 €        Demolition comes to us with a release, but it has a password        €
 €        protected database, we simply hack into the database and make the   €
 €        program useable without the password or manuals.                    €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : Does ViPER ever plan on putting on some competition with release    €
 €        groups?                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : We are not in here for competition or fame, we are in the scene to  €
 €        provide quality services so that everything comes from 1 group.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : In your opinion, how does ViPER compare to other courier groups     €
 €        such as RiSC, MALiCE, fATE, and MC?                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Well, RiSC is a good courier group, they move things well, and I    €
 €        commend them on that, but we will not compare to their level of     €
 €        courier ability because we do so many other things.  MALiCE is      €
 €        another good courier group, and they compare well with RiSC, they   €
 €        move things very well and are very orgnized, but all they can do    €
 €        is courier, and that makes them one dimensional.  fATE is a great   €
 €        courier group, despite some organization problems.  They do get     €
 €        things done, but once again, they can only courier, and that makes  €
 €        them one dimensional.  MindCrash is a well rounded group, but they  €
 €        have had a lot of personal problems in the past.  I think having a  €
 €        well structured group builds a basis from which to learn from.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So in general, you feel that a group that can do many different     €
 €        things is better than a group that specializes in one area.  Why    €
 €        is it then, that all big groups, such as PWA, DOD, RZR, and LGC,    €
 €        concentrate only in one area, whether it is releasing utilities or  €
 €        games?                                                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : Because doing what those groups do require total attention.  Since  €
 €        you named release groups, they don't have time for other things.    €
 €        They are focused on one thing, getting those warez out, and that    €
 €        is understandable.                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So you are saying that that couirer groups, because they do not     €
 €        have to worry about releasing, have more time to work on other      €
 €        things such as cracking.  What is your opinion on courier groups    €
 €        that also release?                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : For a courier group to release as well as courier is a great.  It   €
 €        shows they are orginized and well staffed.  A group who does both   €
 €        is the best group in my book, it shows they can handle their own    €
 €        releases and do not need help.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €   Q  : So I assume that, as ViPER gets better, it will also release?       €
 €        Will that ever conflict with members who are in ViPER who also      €
 €        supply for other groups.                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €   A  : I doubt ViPER will ever get around to releasing.  We would have to  €
 €        be VERY large staffed to do so, and it would take up too much of    €
 €        our time.  I think growing and getting better at the task at hand   €
 €        will help us.                                                       €

 €      Well, once again we see the sparks fly in RoR, this time things were  €
 €  a bit different.  This was probably the biggest conflict involving RoR    €
 €  so far, hopefully these problems will go away and the group can get back  €
 €  to releasing.  Apparently, gaHn and Incarnate thought that tKLP was       €
 €  using RoR for his own personal benefit, and was the sole reason why RoR   €
 €  had gotten such a bad reputation.  They decided they would kick tKLP out  €
 €  of the group and take it over.  Things didn't work as they hoped and the  €
 €  members stuck behind tKLP more than they did for gaHn and Incarnate.      €
 €  GaHn and Incarnate lost control of #RoR, and things seemed to be going    €
 €  back under tKLP's control.  What lies ahead for the two groups, well RoR  €
 €  seems to basically back to normal, with this incident having little       €
 €  affect on them.  As for Gahn and Incarnate, who knows, perhaps they will  €
 €  start a new group to rival RoR, or maybe they will just stick with other  €
 €  established groups.  tKLP has numerous times proven himself to be a       €
 €  great leader, despite his age which many people are unable to look past.  €
 €  There have been many times that he has overcome great adversities with    €
 €  RoR, and proved himself to be a very experienced and involved person in   €
 €  the scene.  I have nothing but respect for what he has been able to do    €
 €  with RoR through out all these problems, and I wish him good luck         €
 €  keeping RoR alive for a long time.                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Gahn has never been one of my favorite people, I have had a few bad   €
 €  experiences with him, one of the main ones being my expulsion from RoR    €
 €  soon after he became VP.  I tried to point out to people at that time     €
 €  what Gahn was really like.  I do not know whether people believed me,     €
 €  but the overall opinions I have heard recently have been that he is       €
 €  power hungry and ego tripping.  Incarnate is a devoted and hard working   €
 €  person who I personally have never had any problems with.  I know that    €
 €  wherever he goes, he will only help out that group tremendously.          €

 €      I learned today that Gahn will be returning to RoR.  However,         €
 €  Incarnate has been kicked out of RoR.  It seems that Gahn used Incarnate  €
 €  as a scapegoat, and convinced tKLP that the takeover was Incarnate's      €
 €  idea.  Incarnate claims that Gahn was also responsible.  The following    €

 €  <iNCARNATE> If tKLP agrees, we should take a week to recruit the best     €

 €  <iNCARNATE> Here's what we do, we suck up, not too noticeably, to some    €

 €  <gaHn> I would rather make RoR better.  I love the group.  I just don't   €
 €         like the direction it's going.  But if we rename the group, and    €
 €         pull some suppliers, I think we can rock.  Do you think we should  €

 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Well, he considers you as the brother he never had, so call   €
 €              him up, and explain it politely.                              €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> Yea, but he may go balistic...  :)  I have major connections in    €
 €         PWA, DoD, RAZOR, MALiCE, and RiSC.  I think we can start slow and  €
 €         work real hard at releasing the BEST programs on the market.  But  €
 €         we will need Lysergic and JDA to do it.  I can pull in the most    €
 €         elite couriers to come with us also, a cross between RiSC,         €
 €         MALiCE, and so on...                                               €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Couriers get about 1/10 of the group's job done.  They are    €
 €              mainly cosmetic, that is if they are elite.                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> We really need to recruit some suppliers.                          €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Since Hybrid is dying, think we can grab a few from there?    €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> Most of them already went to Razor, but we can try.  Should we do  €
 €         both apps and games?  I think we can release both, but I think we  €
 €         should really think about that.  So let's start testing some       €
 €         people and see who we can recruit.. ok?                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Yeah, can I please have tKLP's phone number?  You want to     €
 €              tell him to fuck off, or can I?                               €

 €  <gaHn> tKLP and I have been fighting alot lately because I'm in MALiCE    €
 €         and he starts trouble with a lot of other groups.  I want us to    €
 €         have the BEST relations with other groups.  RoR files aren't even  €
 €         allowed on "The Wall".  I have to twist tKLP's arm so he doesn't   €
 €         release everything he gets.  It's a fucking battle every day.      €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> He always quits irc in the middle of a conversation, he       €
 €              kicks people out of RoR for the dumbest reasons.              €
 €                                                                            €

 €         Legacy is better than us.                                          €

 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> Yeah, but they are doing well.  I hate that.                       €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Yeah.. sigh.                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> I would stay here but TKLP would have to leave, but I don't want   €
 €         to hurt him.  RoR would get a better name very fast if he left.    €
 €         But as I said, I don't want to hurt him.  Now about me.  A lot of  €
 €         people may not like the way I do things.  They all know that I do  €
 €         a good job and run a group like a real business so that helps us   €
 €         a lot.  I don't take lame shit from anyone, and that's the way it  €
 €         should be.  I have people from MALiCE, RiSC, and DOD telling me    €
 €         all the time that I should just take the group, but I don't want   €
 €         to do that.  I think we can recruit some awesome suppliers.  So    €
 €         what do you think?  Keep RoR or start another group?               €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <iNCARNATE> Let's start recruiting, see how it goes, and if it's not      €
 €              good.  We try and reform RoR, but I think it WILL go good.    €
 €                                                                            €
 €  <gaHn> Whatever we do, I have the support of MALiCE and RiSC, assuming    €
 €         tKLP is not in it.                                                 €

 €              we could rip some suppliers out of CORP since I'm friends     €

 €         RCN or its members.                                                €
 €                                                                            €
 €  Hello RCN readers,                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €  First off, I would like to introduce myself.  I am TRiTE, a new writer    €
 €  on the outstanding RCN staff.  In this issue, I will be reviewing and     €
 €  rating utility groups and their roles in the scene.  I hope I will serve  €
 €  RCN well with well thought-out, unbiased opinions.  My rating system is   €
 €  based on three criteria which I believe all releasing groups should       €
 €  follow.  They are:                                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €     1.  QnQ Theory.  QnQ means "Quality not Quantity."  I believe that     €
 €         all groups should embrace this theory, not worrying about beating  €
 €         everyone else with the speediest release team, but ensuring a      €
 €         quality release, one without errors, virii, or a proper crack.     €
 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €     2.  Group support.  By this I mean a group open to suggestions and     €
 €         criticism without getting overly fizzled by the sutuation.  A      €
 €         group needs input from its end users as to better its team in      €
 €         future releases.                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €     3.  Scene Awareness.  This is perhaps one of the most important of     €
 €         the three.  This is how aware a releasing group is of the scene,   €
 €         what it stands for, and what it means to them.  I rate this based  €
 €         based on how a group treats visitors to their channel, how they    €
 €         respond to inquiries about joining, their participation in         €
 €         spreading their release, and their communication with couriers.    €
 €         Universally, who they are, and the role they play in the scene     €
 €         today.                                                             €
 €                                                                            €

 €      The first group I will be reviewing is "The Corporation."  TC         €
 €  emerged onto the scene a few months ago as a Telecom Courier team.  They  €
 €  have since developed into a strong utility release team.  Headed by       €
 €  'Uncle John' and 'David and Goliath,' this team has played a major role   €
 €  in the utility scene.  Pushing themselves to the very limits of their     €
 €  superior releasing ability, they have dominated the utility scene in      €
 €  past weeks, compromising the integrity of even the oldest and most        €
 €  respected teams.  I feel TC to be a major rising power in the scene in    €
 €  the past weeks, compromising the integrity of even the oldest and most    €
 €  respected teams.  I feel TC to be a major rising power in the falling     €
 €  ranks of neighboring competitors.                                         €
 €                                                                            €
 €       Since January 1, 1996, TC has released approximately thirteen        €
 €  quality releases, embracing the Quality part of the QnQ theory, while     €
 €  surpassing the Quantity component.  So far, I have not heard any          €
 €  complaints on TC releases, so as for now I give TC a 9.5 based on the     €
 €  QnQ Criteria.                                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      I have visited #corp on IRC here and there just to sneak a peek of    €
 €  what they're up to.  I was surprised to see the goings on in this         €
 €  channel.  Potential applicants are greeted respectfully, and given an     €
 €  application as soon as someone can find one <grin>.  Anyone with          €
 €  questions or remars about past, present, and future releases is answered  €
 €  promptly upon request.  This is truly an amazing group with major         €
 €  potential for greatness.  I give them a solid 9 for group support, and a  €
 €  7 in scene awareness.  The reason for the 7 is that I feel, although TC   €
 €  is speedy with quality releases, it seems to me that they are a little    €
 €  pre-occupied with the Quantity component of QnQ theory, and this is not   €
 €  what the scene is about.  It's not a race of fierce competitors in the    €
 €  underground of computer software, it is the bringing of quality software  €
 €  to all of us WareZies :-)                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Overall, I give TC a rating of 8.5, without neglecting a small        €
 €  margin for improvement.  TC is a great team with strong suppliers!        €
 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €

 €      The next utility releasing group I will be rating is "Drink or Die"   €
 €  (DOD).  DOD is no newcomer to the scene.  In fact, DOD is one of the      €
 €  oldest, most respected utility group in the scene today.  They first      €
 €  emerged several years ago, back in the age of 2400 baud modems, and       €
 €  when the Internet was just being introduced to the warez scene.  DOD has  €
 €  been releasing quality utilities ever since I can remember, and I'm sure  €
 €  it will continue to be a strong force in utilities for a long time.       €
 €                                                                            €
 €      In the past, DOD dominated the scene with their quick releases, but   €
 €  not neglecting the quality.  I feel that recently, DOD has been more      €
 €  concerned with releasing something very fast, with little regard to the   €
 €  size of the ware or its integrity, than with anything else.  Although     €
 €  they have a much lower defect rate on their releases than a lot of other  €
 €  groups, I just don't think they pay as much attention to what they        €
 €  release.  I think last week I saw a 52 disk release of a lawyer program.  €
 €  This is what I'm talking about.  I'm sure a few people might take the     €
 €  time to download that, I'm sure most won't.  So my rating for DOD on QnQ  €
 €  is 7.5.                                                                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €      DOD has been a leader in releasing for years, and since have made a   €
 €  respectful impression in the warez scene, I can only hope other groups    €
 €  strive to achieve what they have accomplished.  I had a hard tiem rating  €
 €  their group support component, as they keep their channel invite only at  €
 €  all times, and I'm told they do all recruiting by mail and on one of      €
 €  their HQ Sites, which is fine, but I do not see any interfacement         €
 €  between the group and the rest of the scene, which as state before, is a  €
 €  major problem if they are trying to improve their team to become more     €
 €  effective in releasing.  So my rating for group support is 7.  DOD has    €
 €  shown us their superior ability in releasing throughout the years, and I  €
 €  feel they have tremendous scene awareness, after all, how could they      €
 €  have survived so long without awareness?  I can't really say much except  €
 €  kudos to DOD for their efforts.  A solid 8 for scene awareness.           €
 €                                                                            €
 €      DOD's longevity and dominance in the scene is an admirable one.       €
 €  They have been among the leading release groups in existance, as long as  €
 €  the scene has existed.  They play a vital role in the existance of the    €
 €  warez scene.  My overall rating of DOD is 7.5.  They have the strength    €
 €  and experience of an able group, and they play a major part in the scene  €
 €  as we know it.  They hvae achieved greatness and have done, and to this   €
 €  day, still do their part.  It might possibly be that their experience     €

 €      Finally, "Pirates with Attitudes" (PWA) has been around since the     €
 €  birth of the scene as we know it.  They practically invented it!  PWA in  €
 €  the past has been the role model for groups, to achieve excellence and    €
 €  respect, small groups on the rise used PWA as their goal.  If they could  €
 €  rank with PWA, they would have done what few groups have ever done.       €
 €  That is still the case today.                                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      PWA has had approcimately 17 releases in the January 1-January 10,    €
 €  1996 time frame, completely obliterating all competition.  They have had  €
 €  a continual omnierous presence in the scene since their birth and are     €
 €  still today, which is why I rate them a solid 10 for QnQ theory.          €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Since PWA's merger with SCuM I have not heard of any recruiting.      €
 €  Their channel is locked, invite only.  I am not sure ohw they recruit or  €
 €  if they even recruit at all.  In this case I don't see a problem with     €
 €  this, because from what I have seen, it definitely works for them!        €
 €  Although this is not good practice for a group, I give them a 7 on group  €
 €  support.                                                                  €
 €                                                                            €
 €      PWA has basically been a closed group, open to only the best          €
 €  traders, sites, and suppliers.  They give a new meaning to excellence,    €
 €  and are an evident role model among competitors.  They have strived       €
 €  throughout the years to be their best and have done what few have done,   €
 €  survived.  I rate PWA a 9 in scene awareness.  Overall, I rate PWA a 8.7  €
 €  because they could use some work on group support.                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €                                                                            €

 €      To recap, I see The Corporation as a rising entity n the util scene   €
 €  with the talent and potential to be a great group.  Drink or die has      €
 €  always been a major competitor, but lately have just slumped in other     €
 €  areas.  Pirates With Attitudes as always is the leader in the util scene  €
 €  with tremendous power and prestige.  I just hope they do not fall prey    €
 €  to their egos.                                                            €

 €      The problem with user response is that they all fear the IRCOps,      €
 €  thinking that an IRCOp will /kill them when they come on, or kill them    €
 €  when they speak to them.  And that fear is wrong, I cannot believe that   €
 €  IRC could ever become so hostile in such a short period of time.  I am    €
 €  also angry at the IRCOps who do not confront other IRCOps who do wrong!   €
 €  It has been a few weeks since the problem with Piker, and there are       €
 €  still no responses, and no actions.  This gives users of IRC a reason to  €
 €  fear the IRCOps, because as "Piker" epitomized, IRCOps can do anything    €
 €  to anyone, without reason, right or wrong, and it will go unheard and     €
 €  unpunished.  So users on irc, beware, the "irc.portal.com" IRCOps, they   €
 €  can do whatever they want, to whomever they please.                       €

 €      Well, this doesn't make much sense but the facts are, an attempt at   €
 €  taking over Anti Derivative was foiled, or was it an attempt?  Who        €
 €  knows, better yet, ask who cares, but as Ctiger was stating it was no     €
 €  little thing.  It all started when Ctiger made a statement that the Prez  €
 €  and VP are NEVER around, and she thinks they should be around more        €
 €  often.  Anti Derivative and god didn't take that lightly, but it got      €
 €  worse, Ctiger also said that Anti Derivative should not be the Prez of    €
 €  fATE and that it should be Touch Tone, and no one else.  She basically    €
 €  said that Anti Derivative was worthless, but he was not going to stand    €
 €  by idly.  What started as a "voicing of opinions" soon turned into a      €
 €  large swearing match, Ctiger was called an "IRC Whore", etc.  But why is  €
 €  all this fighting happening if there was no takeover attempt?  Touch      €
 €  Tone said, "I saw no mutiny.  There was no attempt.  I was not involved   €
 €  in a takeover of the senior staff of fATE."  Which was true, but what     €
 €  Ctiger was saying that some of the lagging members in fATE, such as Anti  €
 €  Derivative, could be replaced.  However, Touch Tone said he would NEVER   €
 €  take the position of Prez of fATE unless Anti Derivative stepped down.    €
 €                                                                            €
 €      As god said earlier, "Ctiger brought out that truck driver part of    €
 €  her we didn't know about, and she said things unforgivable."  The funny   €
 €  part is, she was trying to say that Anti Derivative was a bad Prez        €
 €  because he was not online much, but he was not online much because he     €
 €  was busy taking care of the fATE boards, off of the internet, which is    €
 €  very commendable.  So Ctiger's hope of pinning an "Inactive"  Anti        €
 €  Derivative failed miserably, and in the process, showed her real side,    €
 €  proving that fATE cannot have her as a member.                            €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Not to say anything bad about Ctiger, but here's something for her,   €
 €  "Look before you leap" because jumping out on those very fragile LIMBS    €
 €  is a dangerous thing.  As you saw the other day, they can BREAK."         €

 €      Well, speaking of ass kickings, this is a good example of one, I'm    €
 €  not REALLLY downing on Inquisition, because they have had some good       €
 €  stuff, but otherwise, THEY SUCK.  I mean, may be saying this will wake    €
 €  them up a bit, and get them starting on working on their text e-mag       €
 €  again.  I was talking to a guy named Raptor, in PWA about something I     €
 €  thought they would like to know.  Some guy named Aftershock, who knows    €
 €  who he is, but all I know  is that he is GAY.  Anyways, Aftershock was    €
 €  claming he was the PWA Prez, so I contacted someone in PWA and I got      €
 €  Raptor.  Raptor claimed HE was the Prez of PWA and foudner of INQ.  We    €
 €  conversed and he said he never heard of anyone called Aftershock, and     €
 €  that it was all bullshit.  I told him that if Aftershock was real, I'd    €
 €  publish it, he got all offensive and said, "It's BULLSHIT".  The way he   €
 €  sounded, I got feelings that he was hiding something, VERY BIG.  Then I   €
 €  told him I would not publish lies, but maybe INQ would like to publish    €
 €  it.  Unaware of INQ policy, he got very offenisve, yelled at me, and      €
 €  started calling me names.  So I just laughed at him, and get even more    €
 €  angry.  I asked him what was his problem, and he said "You knocking       €
 €  INQ?", in a threatening tone.  I was only asking whether or not they'd    €
 €  publish that.  Who the fuck cares, quit being a woman about it.  He then  €
 €  proceeded to ignore me, like I care.                                      €
 €                                                                            €
 €      Let's get down to the facts, RCN has a WELL coded E-Mag, INQ does     €
 €  not.  RCN has more appealing articles and interviews, and more reader     €
 €  response, INQ doesn't.  I'm not just making this shit up out of hot air.  €
 €  This is from READER response and from comparable subjects.  Fact : RCN    €
 €  has thousands of READERS all over the Internet.  Fiction : RCN does NOT   €
 €  have a text version, check the zip, for all those Unix users.  In my      €
 €  days as a writer for RCN, I have NEVER EVER had this many people come up  €
 €  to me and prasing RCN.  Funny how we get so much response, and we don't   €
 €  even have a DAMN channel.                                                 €

 €      To INQ, some final comments, do some coding, add some music, your     €
 €  E-Mag AINT got all the articles.  Better luck next time!                  €

 €                                                                            €
 €      This is just a quick note to group leaders.  There are too many       €
 €  nowadays, and that means that to become better than another group, you    €
 €  really don't have to work very hard.  With this, come a lot of problems   €
 €  with egos.  The minute a group gets big, or at least bigger than          €
 €  another, its leaders get all egoistical and start treating members like   €
 €  shit.  I saw this a few days ago with a member applying to Legacy.  It    €
 €  was a member applying as a supplier, we chatted a bit, and decided that   €
 €  we would accept him as a games-only supplier.                             €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The decision made by the member himself was that he would supply all  €
 €  of his games to Legacy, and probably his utils to ROR, something I look   €
 €  very deeply into because it was no longer my matter.  Not a minute after  €
 €  the decision was made and I announced to the group that we were           €
 €  welcoming a new member, tKLP (of whom we've spoken too much in this       €
 €  issue the way it is) spurted out "He's MINE!!"  He proceeded to say that  €
 €  ROR would offer him more than Legacy would.  I haven't stopped thinking   €
 €  about the incident since.                                                 €
 €                                                                            €
 €      The member was brought into the group upon his own will.  He was not  €
 €  bought into the group with a senior position or anything to that nature.  €
 €  He applied, and we accepted.  Telling him that another group would offer  €
 €  him more is like luring a dog in with a bigger dinner plate than the      €
 €  neighbor gave him.  Suppliers, if anybody, are usually treated worse      €
 €  than anybody else, which seems rather backwards to me.  Suppliers,        €
 €  because they are often not conversed with as much, are seen less and      €
 €  thus have their opinions ignored.  We can't treat our members as dogs,    €
 €  nor can we continue to be so egoistical.  One thing I have learned        €
 €  through my time in the scene is that you get nowhere by being an asshole  €
 €  to everybody you see.  It only damages relations with others, and will    €
 €  ultimately get banned off of every channel/board/friends list you ever    €
 €  try to set foot on.                                                       €

 €                                                                            €
 €      From my sources, I have learned that the Hybrid leaders, are          €
 €  currently leeching off of the government of United States.  I must also   €
 €  assume then, because the Hybrid leaders are on Welfare, they must have    €
 €  a lot of free time on their hands.  This information is unconfirmed, but  €
 €  the word of the hour claims that the Hybrid leaders, because they pay     €
 €  their suppliers, are in financial troubles.  In order to get out of       €
 €  their humongous debt, the Hybrid leaders must find MONEY to repay their   €
 €  suppliers.  What's the quickest way to MONEY?  Welfare.                   €
 €                                                                            €
 €      According to my calculations, if the Hybrid leaders, did not eat,     €
 €  and sold all their food stamps, and saved the rest of their money.  Then  €
 €  perhaps they could get out of their debt by mid February or early March.  €
 €  The Scene is in need of another good games group such as Hybrid, with     €
 €  the death of TDU-JAM, the scene slumped horribly, and it would be sad to  €
 €  see Hybrid die as well.  However, I would like to show sympathy for a     €
 €  great group such as Hybrid.  First off, their leaders are probably        €
 €  unemployed, third class citizens with low morale, so they have all this   €
 €  free time making Hybrid a good group, and then, they have to watch their  €
 €  group die due to financial problems.  A good games group such as Hybrid   €
 €  must certainly help lift up the spirits of their poor leaders, and to     €
 €  see Hybrid die must be heart breaking.  I hope those problems are         €
 €  resolved soon, if not, I hope that Hybrid at least lives on for a long    €
 €  time, after all, it's a nice name.                                        €
 €                                                                            €
 €      However, if the Republicans, lead by Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, get  €
 €  the cutbacks on Welfare and Medicaid, then the Hybrid leaders would be    €
 €  getting a pay cut, and in turn, it would take til around late March or    €
 €  early April before Hybrid gets back up.  So for those of you who do not   €
 €  like Hybrid, vote Republican, and for those of you who like Hybrid, vote  €
 €  Democrat.  However, you must also remember, Republicans respect the 2nd   €
 €  ammendment (right to bear arms), and also respect the freedom of the      €
 €  internet (speech), and have not expressed much in regards to regulating   €
 €  pirated software.  For those of us old enough to vote, it will be a hard  €
 €  choice indeed.                                                            €

 €      Ops.  The term that has come to mean so much to some of us.  What is  €
 €  it really?  A small ascii symbol, but to some it is more likely their     €
 €  source of power and maybe even their ego.  People seem to go into         €
 €  channels and beg for them.  They say that they will do anything to gain   €
 €  it, but why?  Is having the power to kick/ban/invite/whatever so great?   €
 €  In my opinion, no.  Sure it is nice to have and it does have many         €
 €  advantages, but other then that. it is a bunch of pixels grouped in a     €
 €  small symbol.  People, GET OVER IT.  If having a @ next to your name      €
 €  means so much, then you have to get out more!  Having a @ does not mean   €
 €  you're cool or k-rad.  Are you trying to impress your friends by saying   €
 €  that you have ops in #Warez5000 because then, you can just kick those     €
 €  really lame AOL people.  Let me tell you something, those AOL peopole     €
 €  are no worse then you if you are like that.  RCN reported last issue on   €
 €  the IRC Ops and how they just ban because out of pure selfishness,        €
 €  without regards to improving the Internet.  If you have a @ in channel,   €
 €  respect it, but don't worship yourself.  If it is taken away from you,    €
 €  it does not mean you are an idiot or that people hate you.  It is merely  €
 €  nothing special.                                                          €
