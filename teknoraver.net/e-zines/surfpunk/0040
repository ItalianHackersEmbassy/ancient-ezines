John Gilmore (one of the first employees of Sun) challenges 
your cryptanalytic abilities for a public service.

It would probably be a public service if some interested parties were
to determine the ``encryption'' method that Sun Express, the standard
Sun ``license manager'', and other packages use.  At the moment, the
details of these technologies are not described in the public
literature (as far as I know).

Rather than have these companies discover years too late that their
"unlockable" software is really unlockable by anyone who understands
cryptography, it'd be better for them to learn it this year, while
they are still handling low volumes of programs that way.  Also maybe
they will stop dumping these programs-that-you-have-but-must-pay-to-run on us.

         SunExpress Unveils One-Stop Shopping From the Desktop

SunFLASH Vol 49 #21					        January 1993 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                New CD-ROM and facsimile services 
     make it easier than ever to select and purchase products
  
 
CHELMSFORD, Mass. --January 26, 1993-- SunExpress, a subsidiary of
workstation industry leader Sun Microsystems, Inc., today announced two
new customer services which simplify information retrieval and product
ordering.  FaxInfo(SM), which allows SunExpress customers to access
product information and order product through their fax machine, is
available now.  A second program will allow SunExpress customers to
"unlock" software applications directly from SunSoft's Catalyst
CDware(TM), the most widely-distributed demo CD for users of the
UNIX(R) operating system.  The CD-ROM program is being implemented in
twenty customer sites on a trial basis and will be generally available
later this year with Catalyst CDware Volume 5.0.

The integration of these technologies, coupled with other electronic
ordering innovations planned for release later in 1993, will allow
SunExpress to process orders more efficiently and provide a higher
level of customer satisfaction.  Eventually, these process innovations
will result in drastically fewer written orders, smaller inventories,
less postage, phone and freight costs, resulting in reduced costs for
SunExpress customers.

"SunExpress is committed to providing its customers with leading-edge
technologies that will make it easier than ever for them to select and
purchase products.  The new programs announced today are just the
beginning," said Dorothy Terrell, president of SunExpress.  "In the
near future, our customers will be able to browse through full color
on-line catalogs, watch video demonstrations and try out software all
without leaving their workstation."

FaxInfo

The FaxInfo program allows SunExpress customers to access detailed
product information about catalog offerings within minutes.  By calling
into the regular SunExpress ordering and information number
(800-USE-SUNX), customers can access FaxInfo and have technical data
sheets faxed back to the location of their choice by using the
touch-tone keypad on their phone.  SunExpress maintains up-to-date
datasheets on all of the products that it offers and makes revisions to
product specs as they are made available.

SunExpress joins with SunSoft's Catalyst CDware Program

Sun(TM) workstation users currently have access to SunSoft's Catalyst
CDware program which allows them to run demo versions of a range of
UNIX software applications from several major ISV's and decide whether
it is something they would like to buy.  With SunExpress' participation
in the program, interested customers can purchase and obtain a
fully-functional version of their chosen software -- all in one
toll-free phone call.

Currently this program is being tried out at twenty customer sites with
limited software product offerings including: Clarity's Rapport(TM),
and Ta-Dah!(TM) and SimCity(TM) from Dux Software.  The program is
targeted for full implementation with many more titles this summer, and
will be attractive to ISVs who are already marketing their product
through Catalyst CDware from SunSoft.  Catalyst CDware currently
carries 73 product presentations from 54 different vendors.

"We feel that this service from SunExpress can only enhance the
effectiveness and impact of our Catalyst CDware program," said Peter
Schakow, Manager of CD programs at SunSoft.  "We look forward to
providing this added service to our Catalyst CDware partners."

ISVs are interested in the SunExpress distribution strategy as a new
sales channel. "This program will greatly facilitate our marketing
efforts into the Sun installed base," said Bob Adams of DUX Software.
"In addition to assisting with new product sales, it will be extremely
useful and cost effective for distributing product enhancements and
upgrades."

SunExpress, a subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, Inc. provides customers
with easy access to a wide range of Sun and innovative 3rd party
products at low competitive prices and same day shipping.  SunExpress
supports SPARC(R), Solaris(R), and other computing environments based
on the UNIX operating system.  The company offers a 30-day no fault
return policy and is currently serving customers in the United States,
Europe and Japan.  SunExpress can be reached at 1 (800) USE-SUNX and is
headquartered in Chelmsford, MA.

          BUGS
              It would be better to use a real 56-bit key rather  than
              an ASCII-based  56-bit  pattern.  Knowing  that  the  key
              was derived from ASCII radically reduces the time
              necessary  for a brute-force cryptographic attack.
