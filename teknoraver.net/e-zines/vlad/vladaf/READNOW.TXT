
 Although the magazine has VGA detection, if it should somehow fail
 then run 'VLAD-AF' with any parameter and the VGA stuff will no
 longer be displayed.

 If you are running softice, the magazine tends to reboot the computer
 due to anti-debugging code we have put in it.  Better to remove soft-ice
 from memory altogether.
