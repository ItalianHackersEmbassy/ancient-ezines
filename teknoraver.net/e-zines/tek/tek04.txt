TeK UpDaTeZ
-----------
There are no new updates for this issue. Unfortunatly, but thats because
both Exist and I (MiND FLaYER) have been on vacation for a total of 2 weeks
since last issue, and we havent had time to do much. Anyways, heres issue 4.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TeK has dropped a member, Elektrik, as he was not interested in helping the
group out, and he was greedy, so he has been nuked. We might be interested
in excepting a new member in his place, so start sending in articles, and
maybe youll be the next TeK memba. One more thing, there is no hall of lame
this issue, due to the fact that no body has done anything to piss either
Exist or I off, so lets keep it that way :) There is not much real info
in this issue, we threw in a bunch of wardials to let you hackerz out there
play with some shit, if any of you kidz out there get anything on the systems
listed, let us know.



                                 .<Intro>.

Shit... wassup? ExiSt here.. I'm on my way to San Francisco for a few weeks, 
so I kinda had to write this article up in a hurry, hope you learn something
from it.. I'll be sure to let you all know what San Francisco is like.. I 
hope to get some pictures, and some info.. (lots of gay bashing!! YEAH!)

Anyways, here's my info on beige boxing.
                     
                              .<Beige Boxing>.

DISCLAIMER:  I'm telling you HOW to do this shit, not TO do it.. If you mess
up and get busted, don't come crying to me, or ANY TEk member, because we
are not responsible for any actions, direct or indirect, that you cause
upon yourself after reading this, or any TEk article.
END DISCLAIMER.

Alright.. all formalities outta the way, let's get started. 


How To Build A Beige Box:
-------------------------

This is a fairly EASY thing to do. Take any phone wire with 1 phone jack
on it. Cut off one end, leaving the phone jack, and cut BACK the 1st outter 
plastic coating. You should now see either 2, or 4 wires. Red, Green, Black 
and yellow. You are interested in the green and red only, for now. Cut off 
the black and yellow wires, leaving you will this:         
                     
		                      / (red)
        (jack)                       /
        ⁄ƒƒƒø                       / 
        ∆Õ  √------------- 
        ¿ƒƒƒŸ     (cord)                (green)  
                                     
Now, strip the red and the green wires, so that you have copper wire sticking
out of both of them. Attach the red and green wires into 2 aligator clips.

Plug the jack into the back part of a phone, and that is your simple beige
box.

Beige boxes can be more complex than the one described here. You can simply
attach the jack to the Handset of your phone, and bring along a tone dialer, 
which can be found at electronic stores, like Radio Shack, for about 20-30$,
and they run off batteries.. but, for all intense and purposes, this Beige
Box should do you just fine.

Now, technicalities.

Beige Boxing:
-------------
(Note: Where the word TELCO appers, replace with your TelCo, ie: BCTEL, BELL, 
GTE, AT&T, Whidbey, SaskTel etc..)


I will now explain to you in detail how to put your beige box to use. This
is the easiest way I could think of.

On the side of almost everybodies house, near the Hydro-Meter, is a little
grey box, usually marked TelCo. Now, not all these boxes are the same. Some
are about the size of a box of cookies, and is locked with both a Philips 
Screw, and a special TelCo screw, which is a hexagon, with a small point in 
the middle, making it impossible to open without a modded Screw driver. But,
don't fear, there ARE ways around this! (no shit..)

A: Go to the house you are planning to Beige, and use a blow torch 
(with a propane tank) to simply melt the plastic back. Voila!

B: Mod a haxagon shaped screw driver, like this:

   ____   (thats the screw driver head)
  /    \
 ≥      ≥
  \____/

   _____   (Thats the TelCo Screw Head)
  /     \
 ≥   O   ≥
  \_____/

Now, do THIS to your screw driver head:

   ____    (Cut with a hack saw where the === is)
  /    \
 ≥======≥
  \____/

Your screw driver will now open TELCO Screws. 

C: Simply rip the fucker off the wall, and hope for the best. Go for a quick
walk, make sure no one heard the noise, then go back and beige it.

Okay, that is one type of TelCo box.

The others may be the size of a pack of smokes, and simply open by lifting
upwards, very easy.

So, now, you're now in the TelCo box, and you see this:


                        ---------------------     0 Screws
                        |                   |     
                        |   (gr)     (red)  |     ≥
                        |    0         0    |      \  (Wires)
                        |    ≥ (ground)≥    |       \ 
                        |    /    0    /    |
                        |   /     ≥   /     |
                        |  / 0    ≥  / 0    |
                        |  ≥      ≥  ≥      |
                        |  ≥      ≥  ≥      |
                        |///////////////////|
                         lots of wires an' shit

So, you see either 3, or 5 screws, positioned like above. The middle screw
is the ground, it SHOULD have a larger green wire attached to it, leading out
the bottom. The top two are the phone lines. Connect your alligator clips to
the corresponding screws, and pick up your handset. If you hear a dialtone, 
your connected, if not, try switching the alligator clips around, or try the
bottom two screws. If there is NO wire connected to the ground, connect the 
RED wire first, and be quick, or else you'll get a quick jolt of 50v DC..
it kinda hurts..;)

So, now you're connected, you've got dialtone, now what? Call your friend
across town? HELL NO!! ;)

Here are some places to call:

DefCon Voice Bridge: 1-801-855-3326
Alt.2600 Voice BBS:  1-516-473-2626
Your Friend in Albakerky ;)
1-900-anything

But, be sure to have a list of number handy with you, and a mental plan 
of who you're gonna call, so that you're not stuck there at 2am, outside 
hiding in someones shrubs, with no one to call.

Other Places to Beige Box:

Okay, now say you don't want to risk beiging a house, or there aren't many
houses where you live, try beiging your neighberhoods Line Collecter. It's a
small box, found about every 8th house. Take the cover off. Inside are many,
many wires. Try to find two that look like they are together. Cut them in 
half, splice them, and hook your aligator clips up, if you don't get a 
dialtone, keep playing.. there should be a hundred or so pairs in the box,
one pair is BOUND to work.

An RLu. Its a grey building, about 6 feet tall, 1 foot wide. It has two
double doors on each side, with two padlocks on each side as well. If you
can get into on of those, it's has about 10x more wires as the Line Collector
and the pairs are already sorted, and numbered. Again, find a pair, cut them,
splice them and connect your clips to them. Get dialtone, Call. ;)

Okay, now, be very careful when doing this. If you get caught, they can
possibly charge you with:

-Mischeif
-Destruction of Private Property
-Theft of Telecommunications
-Possession of a Device used to obtain illegal Telecommunications
-Vandalism
-Tresspassing

Now, they won't charge you with ALL those, but, that is just a list of 
possible charges they could give you.

Anyways, have fun beige boxing. I hope some of you learned SOMETHING from
this..  it is all pretty basic, but, you must start somewhere..

The 374 WarDial

Okay, here's my 374 wardial. About 6 months ago, I dialed every number
in Kamloops. Every exchange. I will be adding 1 scan every now and then
in TEk Magazine. Now, be careful with theses numbers. ALWAYS use some
sort of ANI Blocker, whether it be *67 or Op Divert..

Wassup? ExiSt here, back atcha with another WarDial.. okay, here's
my 1-800-742-xxxx scan.. only found about 20 carriers.. a few are
pretty fun. Remember.. Op Divert first, and don't fuck too long with
the boring shit.. get the prompt, and learn the commands.. anyways,
here's the scan.. have fun.
                                                                .
Some of the carriers in this wardial are the same as the above /:\ 800
wardial, but some are different, so im throwing both log files  | in.
ExiSt,                                                          |
